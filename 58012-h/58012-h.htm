<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
AMICUS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Lambeth</i>, 1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> waded through many deep
waters of late, and, I hope, learned many interesting lessons in
the School of the Cross, I cannot forbear dropping you a few
thoughts on the great things of God.&nbsp; It is my mercy and
yours, that our salvation is the joint work of the adorable
Trinity in Unity, originating in eternal love, planned in
infinite wisdom, and executed by almighty power.&nbsp; This
salvation I have been led to prise, of late, more than ever I
did; and to bless a covenant God that I ever heard its joyful
sound; that I was ever convinced of my need of its blessings;
that I ever was enabled to receive it as my own: which glorious
salvation consists in the pardon of sin&mdash;the acceptation of
the Saviour&rsquo;s obedience&mdash;the clear witness of
God&rsquo;s Spirit&mdash;and the happy heart-felt communion with
God.&nbsp; This is the salvation of the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Gospel I have been made acquainted
with in some degree, and trust I shall yet more abundantly, even
in this present life, and beyond the grave be favored with it in
body and soul for ever.&nbsp; This is what I have in humble hope
and expedition, and God declares it shall not be cut off.&nbsp;
The Spirit of God is given us as an earnest of this, and faith is
the evidence of it&mdash;and though I am not yet in the enjoyment
of it, the promise still stands firm, <i>Thine eyes shall see the
king in his beauty&mdash;they shall behold the land that is far
off</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thine</i> eyes: are you inclined to ask, Whose
eyes?&mdash;the answer is ready&mdash;those who are in possession
of a good work of grace&mdash;hence, <i>having begun the good
work</i>, <i>he will perform it unto the day of Jesus
Christ</i>.&mdash;Sometimes you hope, you believe, you trust, nay
you are sure this work is begun; then I am sure it will be
carried on, and must be completed; for the Man will not be in
rest till the great work is done, and he presents us to himself a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, nor any such
thing.&nbsp; May you and I live in the pleasing prospect of this,
and finally, die to enjoy it&mdash;no doubt it will be an heaven
worth dying for&mdash;when I contemplate this glory, I forget the
trials of the way.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, my dear friend, while reading this, is
particularly tried <i>in</i> the way; <i>for as vinegar upon
nitre</i>, <i>so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
heart</i>.&nbsp; Well, then, I must pay you a visit <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in
Achor&rsquo;s vale, where I know you are truly safe, though
miserable; reflecting on the days that are past, and contrasting
them with what you now feel and fear&mdash;once feeling light,
joy, peace, comfort, love, zeal, activity, and diligence; but now
you feel darkness, insensibility, lowness the workings of inbred
sin, and too often have to lament the out-breakings of
them.&nbsp; This may be succeeded by legal bondage, unbelief,
fretfulness, enmity, and a sad distance between God and the soul;
and instead of activity and diligence, a general stupor; calling
all in question, because you cannot act as you have formerly
done&mdash;quite forgetting him that has said, and who is now
making good his promise, <i>Even the youths shall faint and be
weary</i>, <i>and the young men shall utterly fail</i>, <i>but
those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength</i>.</p>
<p>Permit me, my brother, just to intimate, that there is nothing
singular in your trials; it appears to be the very path the
Redeemer went, and the very footsteps of the flock.&nbsp; Hence
we read, directly after the Baptism of our dear Lord, when his
soul was filled with all the fulness of God; when the Father,
with an audible voice, proclaimed from above, <i>This is my
beloved Son</i>!&mdash;and the Holy Spirit was seen hovering over
his head, in a body of light, just like a Dove in its
descent&mdash;the Redeemer rising from the watery tomb, and the
gazing spectators astonished at the solemn
scene&mdash;immediately <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>after this transaction we find him led
into the Wilderness to be tempted of the Devil; and he was with
the wild beasts, and evil angels came to him; and upon the back
of this, Satan, the head, the chief Devil, most daringly tempted
him to presumption, to doubt his Sonship, and to commit
suicide!&mdash;and can my brother wonder that he is a subject of
temptation&mdash;<i>that</i> he has forty days of mourning,
without a spiritual entertainment, or the manifestative presence
of Christ&mdash;<i>that</i> he is among the wild beasts of his
inbred sins&mdash;that evil thoughts stirred up by evil angels,
should ever trouble or visit him?&nbsp; And can you wonder that
you should be tempted to doubt your sonship&mdash;tempted to
presume&mdash;that is, forbear to use the scripture means in time
of trouble, or even tempted to suicide?&nbsp; You think some
strange thing has happened to you, but this is the path the
Redeemer trod, in his measure&mdash;and, recollect, the servant
is not greater than his Lord&mdash;it is enough to be as he was,
that we may be as he <i>is</i>.&nbsp; This part of your
experience was strikingly exhibited in the case of the
Israelites, who came through the Red Sea with joy and
praise&mdash;shouted victory, through the mercy of
Jehovah&mdash;and felt happy that they were delivered.&nbsp; But
their felicity was soon abated, for they were ordered to encamp
at Marah, in the Wilderness.&nbsp; So you find it: you have been
convinced of your lost state; you have felt the slavery of sin
and the Devil; you have felt the bondage of the Law; you have
seen <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the
Redeemer making an atonement for sinners: your faith has received
this; your hope has enjoyed this; your love has been led out to
him in sweet return; and though you still felt yourself a sinner,
yet your mind was happy in Jesus, his glorious Person, and his
great Work.&nbsp; Here you sung with Moses and Miriam, with
gospel ministers and people, <i>The Lord is my strength and my
song</i>, <i>he also is become my salvation</i>, <i>and I will
exalt him</i>.&nbsp; But your note was soon changed, for you
presently found yourself in the wilderness of fears, lest you had
been deluded, and lest you had presumed&mdash;lest your grief had
been like Esau&rsquo;s, and your joys the raptures of a way-side
hearer; quite forgetting that that religion which comes from God,
always leads to God, as our salvation and our eternal all.&nbsp;
This was certainly your experience; then why doubt the reality of
it?&nbsp; The commandment has gone forth, that you, for wise and
God-glorifying purposes, should pitch your tent at Marah; here
you must taste of the bitter cup of sorrow.&nbsp; This will only
endear the Tree of Life to you, who was cut down, and cast into
deeper waters than you can possibly go into; and will lead your
faith to apprehend, that though your waters are deep and bitter,
yet faith tastes them sweet, by virtue of Christ&rsquo;s removing
the curse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus believing we rejoice,<br />
To see the curse removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Your
path may indeed be hard and thorny, but, bless God, there is no
curse in it; let this console your mind, I am sure it will, if
the Holy Spirit gives you power to believe it.&nbsp; Your present
experience of darkness, guilt, deadness, bondage, contraction of
spirit, and great stupor, are the days of evil that Solomon
speaks of, which are many, but must at last issue in an exceeding
and an eternal weight of glory.&nbsp; But seeing such are the
days that must come on the followers of the dear Saviour, how
truly important, and how highly interesting that exhortation in
the twelfth of Ecclesiastes, <i>Remember now thy Creator</i>,
<i>in the days of thy youth</i>, <i>while the evil days come
not</i>, <i>and the years draw nigh</i>, <i>wherein thou shalt
say I have no pleasure in them</i>.&nbsp; Solomon could well talk
of these things, for he had a wonderful share of them, and wrote
the whole Book of Ecclesiastes upon the subject.&nbsp; The word
is said by some, to mean the Preacher, but others think it
signifies Restoration to the Church.&nbsp; It was also written by
him in his old age, after his recovery from backsliding; as such
it must be a precious treasure in the hands of a poor sinner, who
knows the plague of his heart, the weakness of human nature, the
inconstancy and mutability of all transitory things, of all
terrestial objects.</p>
<p>This book shews the vanity of all things out of Christ; that
they are fleeting, insubstantial, and disappointing; that they
elude the grasp of their <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>followers, and leave the soul in
darkness, misery, and woe.&nbsp; Having learnt so much by deep
heart-felt experience, of the power of grace and the power of
sin, and having been deeply taught by the Holy Ghost, he advises
as a father to his children, how to act, before the sad days of
tribulation come on; and this is agreeable to his own
declaration, <i>The prudent man foreseeth the evil</i> (i.e.)
<i>day and hideth himself</i>, <i>but the simple pass on and are
punished</i>.&nbsp; Thus in this chapter he exhorts, which,
through God&rsquo;s assistance, I shall consider in an
experimental manner; and shew, I hope, the mind of the Spirit
upon this important theme.</p>
<p>I have often been grieved when this precious text has been
taken by mere Moralists, who knew nothing of the Spirit&rsquo;s
work upon the heart, as the testifier of Jesus; and applied to
youth, literally, who are destitute of the grace of God&mdash;and
by a mere moral harangue, they have set youth to perform a task
they themselves never did.&nbsp; Hence, in general, Sermons are
preached to young people from this passage, when the very passage
shews they are characters that have been taught of God; else why
exhort to a remembrance of that glorious object, Thy Creator? it
must imply some knowledge of him; and this great Creator can only
be known by his own Word and Spirit; only seen in his own light,
<i>for the world by wisdom knows not God</i>, nor <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>can all the
works of God lead us to God, as some dream; there is no coming to
a knowledge of trusting in, or loving, or obeying God, but by the
glorious Mediator, and the impulse of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; I
consider it necessary then, my dear Brother, to shew you,
<i>First</i>, The Characters addressed in this important
exhortation&mdash;the <i>Youth</i>.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, the
grand object recommended to their attention, <i>Thy
Creators</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, What is implied in the idea
of <i>remembering him</i>.&nbsp; <i>Fourthly</i>, The
<i>Arguments</i> the wise man makes use of to urge this important
act, viz. <i>The approach of evil days and years</i>&mdash;which
I shall endeavor to explain in a scriptural and experimental way,
to comfort some poor mourner; to show the value of a precious
Saviour; and endear salvation, by free grace alone.</p>
<p>On the first head of this subject, I would just observe, the
blessedness of being early called by the grace of God, can never
be fully appreciated in this world.&nbsp; We read of some who
were called at a very early period: Jeremiah was really
sanctified from the womb: John the Baptist was filled with the
Holy Ghost in the womb; which shews the possibility of a work of
grace in the souls of those who die in infancy, as they are in
general, if not <i>all</i>, influenced by the Holy Spirit before
their departure, and are passively the subjects of
Regeneration.&nbsp; What a consolation for a parent bereaved of a
<i>lovely babe</i>!&mdash;It appears Joseph was early taught of
God; perhaps <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the first martyr, Abel, was&mdash;it is very clear
Obadiah, Josiah, David, and Solomon, were early converted.&nbsp;
Samuel and Timothy knew the Saviour at a very early
period&mdash;the Lord was their guide from their youth.&nbsp;
This saves a person from many a bitter pang,&mdash;many a sigh,
many a tear, many a deep, black, sad reflection of parents,
broken hearts, violated sabbaths, a despised gospel, a ruined
pocket, and constitution.&nbsp; To be sure grace shines very
bright in the calling of such; but you and I must say, we are
greater debtors to preserving grace.&nbsp; I rejoice your mind
was so early imprest with the power of godliness, and that you
was directed under a sound ministry, which clearly pointed out
the way of salvation, by free grace alone; for the labour of some
foolish preachers wearieth every one, because they know not how
to go to the city.&nbsp; But this is not the youth in the text,
they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed&mdash;the seed of
God; the seed that was to serve the Lord, called the seed of
Jacob; for these the Redeemer entered into a covenant with his
Father&mdash;for these he travailed in spirit, groaned, cried,
obeyed, bled, and died.&nbsp; Hence the promise, <i>He shall see
of the travail of his soul and be satisfied</i>.&nbsp; This is
begun in our conversion, and will be accomplished in our final
glorification.&nbsp; Hence the Psalmist says, <i>As arrows in the
hand of the mighty so are the children of thy youth</i>.&nbsp;
And the matter of the covenant between the Father and the Son, is
thus exhibited&mdash;<i>Thy people shall be willing </i><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span><i>in the day
of thy power</i>, <i>in the beauties of holiness</i>.&nbsp;
<i>From the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy
youth</i>&mdash;which beautiful passage Mr. Hervey translates,
and paraphrases thus: &ldquo;As the morning is the mother of
dews; produces them, as it were, from a prolific womb; and
scatters them with the most lavish abundance, over all the
surface of the earth: <i>So shall thy seed be</i>, O thou
everlasting Father!&nbsp; By the preaching of thy word, shall
such an innumerable race of regenerate children be born to thee,
and fill all lands.&nbsp; Millions, millions of willing converts,
shall <i>croud</i> into thy family, and <i>replenish</i> thy
church; till they become like the stars of Heaven, or the sands
of the sea, for multitude; or even as <i>numberless</i>, as these
fine <i>spangles</i>, which now cover the face of
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the same opinion was the late Mr. Huntington; see his
&ldquo;Light shining in Darkness;&rdquo; on the 110th
<i>Psalm</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The youth which is to spring from the
womb and is to be numerous as the drops of the dew, seem to
<i>be</i> a time yet to come; when the knowledge of the Lord
shall cover the earth&mdash;when a nation shall be born at
once&mdash;when a little one shall become a thousand&mdash;and
when the Lord&rsquo;s family will consist of strong men in the
faith; who are called youth; instead of thy fathers, shall be thy
children, whom thou mayest make Princes in the earth;&rdquo; this
must be when the greatest kingdom under the whole heavens shall
be given to the saints <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of the most high, and they shall take
it, and possess it, for</p>
<blockquote><p>Jesus shall reign where&rsquo;er the Sun<br />
Does his successive journies run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truly excellent Dr. Hawker reads this passage in reference
to the heavenly extraction of the Lord&rsquo;s people, to shew,
That sovereign grace will give to Christ an abundance of souls,
like the dew drops; so numerous as to be perfectly incalculable:
&ldquo;And they shall come of heavenly extraction, as the dew
from God, <i>being born not of the will of the flesh</i>, <i>but
of God</i>; and unperceived, unnoticed, and unknown, as the
silent drops of the morn; <i>for the kingdom of God cometh not by
observation</i>: and as they are begotten like the dew, without
the aid of man, so also shall they be preserved by the same
predisposing cause, without man&rsquo;s descent.&mdash;<i>Not by
might or by power</i>, <i>but by my spirit</i>, <i>saith the Lord
of Hosts</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the youth to whom Solomon writes
are the spiritual seed of God, and not to mere carnal worldly
youth, who are destitute of the knowledge of God.&nbsp; Dear
<i>Amicus</i>, adieu&mdash;Grace and peace be with you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
AMICUS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Lambeth</i>, 1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">BELOVED FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amidst</span> a vast multitude of thoughts
which occurred to my mind this morning, one more than all the
rest, seemed longest to abide, namely, that as the Lord&rsquo;s
people are called Servants as well as Sons, it appears to me that
the services of none are accepted of God, but only the services
of those who are Sons by adoption and graces and by the testimony
of the Holy Spirit in the heart.&nbsp; Such Sons are also called
his Servants, who shall serve him: they were by nature the
servants of the Devil, wore his livery, and did his will; but
Almighty grace having wrought a glorious change in the heart,
there is a change of the service; and this service is not in the
oldness of the letter, but in the newness of the spirit; then it
must be with a new heart, a new spirit; with new views, aims,
pursuits and ends.&nbsp; Into this service we are first
pressed&mdash;<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>then we become volunteers, and though we meet with many
discouragements by the way, yet we are not tired of our Master,
nor he of us; nor do we serve in heart, in affection, in word and
deed, as we wish we could, yet he kindly accepts the will for the
deed, and says, <i>If there be a willing mind</i>, <i>it is
accepted according to what a man hath</i>, <i>and not according
to what he hath not</i>.&nbsp; In the service of so divine a
Lord, our chariot wheels would fain run swift along.&nbsp; My
dear Brother can recollect when his feet run cheerfully in the
way&mdash;<i>ye did run well</i>, <i>who did hinder you</i>? and
you had a divine command for it&mdash;<i>Rejoice</i>, <i>O young
man</i>, <i>in thy youth</i>, <i>and let thy heart cheer thee in
the days of thy youth</i>.&nbsp; Walk in the way of thy new
heart, and in the light of truth that you are favored with; but
it is added, that all this work must be tried, judged, and
proved, that it may appear to be genuine, that what belongs to
God may go to God, and what belongs to nature you may discover,
and lament; for this is the design of the furnace, the design of
the fire of tribulation&mdash;therefore do not be alarmed, as
though some unaccountable thing had happened.&nbsp; In the days
of prosperity you did right to be joyful; in those days of
adversity you must now consider, the Lord approved of the days of
your youth, and even promises a renewal of them; and David
declared he experienced it: this you may see in the following
texts&mdash;<i>I remember thee</i>, <i>and the kindness of thy
youth</i>, <i>and the love of thy </i><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span><i>espousals</i>, <i>when thou
wentest after me in a land that was not sown</i>.&mdash;<i>He
shall return to the days of his youth</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thy youth is
renewed as the Eagle&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; This is experienced after
a season of backsliding and darkness, deadness, and misery.&nbsp;
In these youthful days it is necessary to be diligent, as dark
days may come.&nbsp; Hence the exhortation, <i>Remember thy
Creator in the days of thy youth</i>.&nbsp; These youthful days
do not so much regard the time of life as the time of the light,
love, and liberty of the children of God; these are our first,
best, and sweetest days.</p>
<p>Hence it is said, <i>it is good for a man that he bear the
yoke in his youth</i>: whatever may be the sense of this text, it
is a point beyond all controversy, that it is a mercy to be
taught out of the Law, in our first setting out, to bear the yoke
of our transgressions, and receive deliverance from them by the
precious blood and righteousness of Christ.&nbsp; It is likewise
a mercy to be in the service of Christ, in health and strength of
body and mind; the service of Christ is easy and his burden
light; so he told his disciples, <i>Take my yoke upon
you</i>.&nbsp; The word youth, does not always signify the term
of years; this is evident from Job&rsquo;s pathetic
moan&mdash;<i>O that it was with me as in the days of my
youth</i>, when I was blest with health of body, peace of mind,
cheerful days, plenty of ordinances, and means to get the
knowledge Jesus; and an inclination thereto, while the Spirit <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>taught me to
say, <i>My Father</i>, <i>thou art the guide of my
youth</i>.&nbsp; And hence the apostate and backslider is said,
to forsake the guide of her youth.&nbsp; Thus it appears the time
to remember our creators is the days when first imprest with the
good things of God; when powerfully drawn on by the cords of
love; when we feel strong, lively, warm, and affectionate; when
peace, comfort, and joy, are felt; when the mind is free from
care, vexation, temptation, and misery; when God blesses us with
health and strength, with ministers and books, with ordinances,
and the company of saints.&nbsp; These are our most happy but not
most god-glorifying times; yet, while they last, Solomon advises
a careful attention to great truths, as we may meet with many
crafty, cruel, malicious enemies to God, enemies to the doctrines
of the Trinity in Unity; enemies to the Covenant of Redemption;
enemies to free Grace, to the Work of the Holy Ghost; to the
Divinity and work of the adorable Immanuel; and in fact, to every
revealed truth.&nbsp; So Paul advises, <i>Put on the whole armour
of God</i>, <i>that ye may stand in the evil day</i>.&nbsp; Every
part of this armour will be needed, for it is provided for poor
believers, who have to wrestle hard with sins, and doubts, and
fears, nothing short of an experimental knowledge of the truth
will abide the furnace, will stand in the days of evil, which are
coming on, and which all the Lord&rsquo;s children, either in a
greater or less degree, must endure for <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>it is plain
those who fall away had only the form of godliness, without the
power: there may be a form of sound words, a form of knowledge; a
form of faith, of hope of love, of humility&mdash;this is but
superficial; my dear Brother, I hope, has been convinced of the
danger of this, and that nothing short of the gracious teachings
of the Holy Ghost can satisfy his mind.&nbsp; This leads me to
consider the second particular I promised to attend to in my
first letter&mdash;The glorious object&mdash;<i>Thy
Creators</i>.</p>
<p>I need not tell you I am no scholar, I wish I was; but the
passage must be read in the plural, according to the testimony of
most Hebrew scholars&mdash;<i>Remember now thy</i> <span
class="GutSmall">CREATORS</span>.&nbsp; There are other texts
which must be read in the same way: <i>Where is God thy</i> <span
class="GutSmall">MAKERS</span>, <i>who giveth songs in the
night</i>?&nbsp; <i>Let Israel rejoice in</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THEM</span> <i>that made him</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Thy</i> <span class="GutSmall">MAKERS</span> <i>is thy
husband</i>; <i>the Lord of Hosts is his name</i>.&nbsp; We live
in an awful day, wherein the most crying sin of our nation is the
dreadful opposition to the doctrine of the most adorable Trinity
in Unity, though it is a truth so clearly revealed&mdash;the
foundation of the Church and the christian&rsquo;s highest
glory.&nbsp; Alas! how awfully opposed!&nbsp; Many great and
learned, experimental christians have employed their pens in
proving from sacred scripture, this most glorious point of
Doctrine, the foundation of all the rest.&nbsp; The adversaries
of this truth pretend to hold the Unity of the Godhead&mdash;so
do we.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>They say there is but one God&mdash;so do we; but can
they prove that the Godhead does not, cannot admit of
<i>three</i> distinct Persons in that Essence?&mdash;No!&nbsp;
We, then, who are Trinitarians, can prove that there is but one
simple, undivided Essence; and, that, if there is any truth in
the Bible, there are <i>distinct subsistences</i> in that one
Godhead&mdash;that these three are equal in power, majesty,
dignity, and glory; co-equal, co-essential, and co-eternal.&nbsp;
There are not three Gods, but <i>three Persons</i> in the
Godhead.&nbsp; That there are three distinct Subsistences, which,
for want of better words, we call <i>Persons</i>, is evident from
a vast many passages of scripture&mdash;distinct from each other,
in Person, Name, and Office; for, to what beside the term Person,
can we with any propriety apply the distinct acts of speaking,
working, and commanding?&nbsp; And the Persons in the Trinity are
clearly set forth by their personal characters, such as <i>I</i>,
<i>me</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>thou</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>he</i>.&nbsp;
The scriptures plainly declare that <i>there are three that bear
record in heaven</i>, <i>the Father</i>, <i>the Word</i>, <i>and
the Holy Ghost&mdash;and these three are one</i>&mdash;one in the
divine Essence, undivided, which Essence is peculiar to the
three; yet these have different modes of subsisting in this
Essence, which we must call Persons&mdash;and they must be
Persons, to be Testifiers&mdash;testifying is a personal act; if
the Father is one testifier, the Son another, and the Holy Ghost
a third, they must be three <i>Persons</i>, not three Gods; only
one in the <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>divine Essence, but three distinct in Personality, Name,
and Office.&nbsp; The Unity of the Godhead is exprest in this
text, <i>Hear O Israel</i>, <i>the Lord our God is one
Lord</i>.&nbsp; But the Plurality of Persons in the Godhead is
exprest as before&mdash;<i>There are three which bear record</i>,
<i>the Father</i>, <i>the Word</i>, <i>and the Holy
Ghost</i>.&nbsp; There is one God; this is not said to the
exclusion of the Son and the Spirit, for the Word is applied to
both as well as to the Father, and in the same senses.</p>
<p>This doctrine will still appear more plain, to my dear
brother, by the <i>plural</i> names of God.&nbsp; In the first
verse of the Bible it is evident&mdash;<i>In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth</i>.&nbsp; That this name is
<i>plural</i>, is plain by the work of the distinct
Persons.&nbsp; <i>And the spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters</i>.&nbsp; And the third person is spoken of as the
<span class="GutSmall">WORD</span>, who said <i>Let there be
light</i>.&nbsp; Thus the <i>three in one</i> were concerned in
creation.&nbsp; In Ephesians iii, 9, God is said to create all
things by Jesus Christ&mdash;this is one Person&mdash;Christ is
said to be creator too&mdash;<i>by the word of the Lord was the
heavens made</i>, <i>and all the host of them by the breath of
his mouth</i>.&nbsp; Here is the Word that was with God, and was
God; and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.&nbsp; <i>By his spirit he garnished the heavens</i>,
<i>and his hand framed the crooked Serpent</i>.&nbsp; This is the
Holy Trinity in Unity&mdash;the Persons who said, <i>Let</i>
<span class="GutSmall">US</span> <i>make man in</i> <span
class="GutSmall">OUR</span> <i>image</i>, <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span><i>after</i>
<span class="GutSmall">OUR</span> <i>likeness</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Behold the man is become at one of</i> <span
class="GutSmall">US</span>.&nbsp; <i>Go to</i>, <i>let</i> <span
class="GutSmall">US</span> <i>go down</i>.&mdash;<i>Whom shall I
send</i>, <i>and who will go for</i> <span
class="GutSmall">US</span>?&nbsp; These words clearly prove a
plurality of Persons.&nbsp; <i>If any man love me</i>, <i>my
Father will love him</i>, <i>and</i> <span
class="GutSmall">WE</span> <i>will come unto him</i>, <i>and
make</i> <span class="GutSmall">OUR</span> <i>abode with
him</i>.</p>
<p>In the Epistle of John we read of Communion with the Father,
and the Son; and Paul speaks of Communion with the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; The glorious Covenant of Grace shews a Plurality of
Persons.&nbsp; Divine worship is to be given to the three
Persons.&nbsp; Baptism is in their Names: sometimes one Person is
mentioned before the other; <i>the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ</i>, <i>the love of God</i>, <i>and the communion of the
Holy Ghost</i>; here Christ is first mentioned.&nbsp; <i>The Lord
direct your hearts into the love of God</i>, <i>and into a
patient waiting for Christ</i>.&nbsp; <i>The acknowledgement of
God</i>, <i>and of the Father</i>, <i>and of
Christ</i>&mdash;thus we see the Spirit is mentioned first.&nbsp;
In the first chapter of Ephesians the Father is first
introduced&mdash;Paul prays that the <i>Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ would grant the spirit of wisdom in the knowledge of
Christ</i>.&nbsp; These, and many other passages evidently prove
that there are <i>Three</i> in <i>One</i> and <i>One</i> in
<i>Three</i>, God blessed for evermore; so the Scripture teaches,
and so must we believe; to err in this subject is fatal.&nbsp;
But the Spirit has engaged to lead us into all truth, nor can one
humble follower of Jesus go down to the shades <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of death,
opposing this glorious doctrine.&nbsp; How these are <i>one</i>,
and how each Person subsists in the one Divine Essence, is not
for us to know, nor is it of any importance, it is enough for me
to know, that the terms of Father, Son, and Spirit, are not given
to shew what the Trinity is in the divine Essence, as God; but
what they are to the church in an everlasting Covenant; and this
is life eternal to know the Father, that adopted me as his
own&mdash;to know the Lord Jesus, in the greatness of his
salvation, by the teaching and leading of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;
This is the harmonious witness in the word, and I bless God for
the same in the heart.&nbsp; There are three which bear witness;
and he that believeth on the Son hath the witness in himself; and
this is the witness, the Father says, <i>Yea I have loved
thee</i>; the Redeemer says, <i>I have redeemed thee</i>; and the
voice of the Spirit is known, <i>I have called thee</i>.&nbsp;
This is the point I want you, my brother, to apprehend, to feel,
and enjoy.&nbsp; This is a religion that will stand the test,
will bear the furnace, and all religion, besides what comes from,
and leads to the adorable Trinity, is madness, delusion and
daring presumption!&nbsp; This is the <i>maker</i> or <span
class="GutSmall">MAKERS</span>&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">CREATORS</span>, <i>father</i>, <i>husband</i>,
<i>friend</i>, and <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>The wise man not only points out the glorious Object, but the
Work in which they are engaged, even the Work of Creation.&nbsp;
These glorious Persons <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>having formed the grand plan of
salvation, which was the first great act of Jehovah, in Council
and Covenant, now brings forth the grand theatre of the Universe,
whereon to display the glories of rich, free, restoring grace;
and this act of power, love, wisdom, and goodness, is the joint
Work of the <i>three Persons</i>; as the word <i>God</i> is a
plural term, <i>Elohim</i>, or as some term it
<i>Alehim</i>&mdash;the Persons engaged, the Covenanters.&nbsp;
This is a point that has been long proved by good and great
men&mdash;the several acts of Creation&mdash;God created the
heaven and earth, formed both; then the Spirit&rsquo;s,
act&mdash;<i>and the Spirit of God</i>, the Lord and giver of
life, <i>moved upon the face of the waters</i>, to separate the
parts which were mixed together, and to give them a quickening
virtue, to produce living creatures in them.&nbsp; Then the
Saviour is represented as saying, <i>Let there be light</i>,
<i>and there was light</i>.&nbsp; This came from himself, who is
called the Light of the World.&nbsp; <i>And God said</i> (this is
repeated nine times over; and as the term God is plural, and
includes the Three, there is great propriety and beauty in the
expression) <i>Let</i> <span class="GutSmall">US</span> <i>make
man in</i> <span class="GutSmall">OUR</span> <i>image</i>,
<i>after</i> <span class="GutSmall">OUR</span>
<i>likeness</i>.&nbsp; This consultation is designed to point out
that honor and dignity that was to be conferred on Man, the
noblest work of all his creatures&mdash;<i>in his image</i>, as
God&rsquo;s vicegerent; having dominion over the creatures; erect
in his body; with every excellent endowment of his mind; in
purity, holiness, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>and righteousness; in wisdom and beauty&mdash;thus man
was made in his image.&nbsp; But though this is a great truth,
yet I humbly conceive this is not all; from all eternity God had
a favour towards man; and having exalted the dear Saviour to be
the great Head of the Church, he set him up in the nature of his
people, so that Adam was formed in the nature, in the very image
which God had designed to honour Christ in; that image made he
man: this was agreeable to divine consultation.&nbsp; In this
image our dear Lord four thousand years afterwards made his
appearance; and this was the joint work of the Holy
Trinity&mdash;<i>a body hast thou prepared me</i>.&nbsp; He took
part of the children&rsquo;s flesh and blood&mdash;<i>The power
of the Holy Ghost shall come on thee</i>, <i>and that which shall
be born unto thee shall be called the Child of the Most
High</i>.</p>
<p>Thus the formation of our nature is the joint work of the
Trinity, in the first and second Adam; but this point will appear
of equal importance if we contemplate our New Creation, as the
work of the same divine Persons.&nbsp; Our Regeneration is called
a Creation, but more of this in my next.&nbsp; The best of
blessings attend you.</p>

27</span><i>LETTER III</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
AMICUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>GRACE and peace be with you.&nbsp; I thought it needful to
drop you another Letter on a subject of infinite importance to
you, to myself and to the whole church of God.&nbsp; The Saviour,
in a conversation with a learned and polite Doctor of Divinity,
positively declared the necessity of another, a New, a second
<i>Birth</i>.&nbsp; Blessed be God, the salvation of the children
of God is completed without this, but we must be born again to
know this salvation is ours; and to pretend to lay claim to such
Salvation, without being born again, is most daring
presumption!&nbsp; This <i>new Birth</i> is a change of heart and
life; the formation of a new man; an infusion of holy
principles&mdash;all new&mdash;every thing; that is, every
principle which the Holy Spirit inspires is new; new views, new
sensations, new ideas, new pursuits; and new trials; all is
become new.&nbsp; <i>If any man be in Christ Jesus he is become
new</i>.&nbsp; This birth goes by various names in
scripture&mdash;it is <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>stiled <i>a Calling</i>; <i>The
master is come and calleth for thee</i>.&nbsp; It is represented
as an <i>implanting</i> or <i>engrafting&mdash;Cut off from the
old stock</i>: Our souls cleave to Jesus as our all in all.&nbsp;
It is a <i>Conquest</i>; by the power of the Holy Spirit our
enmity is slain, our wills subdued, and our affections set on
heavenly objects.&nbsp; It is called an <i>heavenly
Birth</i>&mdash;Of the seed of God&rsquo;s word we are said to be
begotten to a lively hope.&nbsp; A new man is formed; for this
the Redeemer travailed in spirit; for this ministers labour and
toil; and to enjoy God in Christ Jesus, no small portion of
spiritual labour falls to the share of the happy possessor.&nbsp;
The Saviour enters the soul; this must create a stir there.&nbsp;
He comes into, and by the door of the heart; all that come in any
other way, as sin and Satan did, are thieves and robbers.&nbsp;
Upon his entrance we, by his light, see our lost state&mdash;feel
our guilt&mdash;conscience is quickened, as well as the mind
enlightened; and here, my brother, you may discover the vast
disparity between the Possessor and the mere nominal Professor;
it is not to be seen either in their light, or conduct, for a man
destitute of the grace of God, may be clear in his head, and
upright in his moral deportment.&nbsp; This is the snare that is
come upon the Churches: these are the false evidences by which
thousands are deceived&mdash;it is not enough, the main spring is
wanting, which is <span class="smcap">Life</span>.&nbsp; This is
the genuine work of God: this proves our union with the Living
Vine.&nbsp; By this life I feel myself condemned by the
Law.&nbsp; I feel a <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>spirit of bondage to fear.&nbsp; I feel the sting of
death.&nbsp; I feel the workings of corruption, which I knew
nothing of before.&nbsp; I feel dreadful apprehensions of
God&rsquo;s wrath; and while my conscience feels these things, I
see, in the light of the word, and by the Spirit, the exact
suitableness of the dear Saviour.&nbsp; I am enabled by the same
Spirit to believe he lived, obeyed, suffered, died, and is risen
again, and receives poor sinners&mdash;the lost, the helpless,
the guilty, and the vile.&nbsp; This begets a hope in my mind
that he will save me.&nbsp; The Promises encourage me&mdash;the
freeness of grace&mdash;the Lord delighting in mercy, through the
satisfaction of Jesus&mdash;the scriptural account of poor
sinners as vile as me being saved.&nbsp; These things encourage
me to hope; while my faith, small as it is, argues at times, as
Manoah&rsquo;s wife did, If the Lord had meant to have destroyed
me, would he have shewed me what I see?&mdash;or told me what he
has?&nbsp; No, no!</p>
<p>But while I thank God, and am taking courage, perhaps sin
again overcomes me&mdash;the Law still works wrath; Satan then
takes the advantage, and down I sink again, and must there lay
till the dear Father of Mercies draw me to Christ again.&nbsp;
Thus the spiritual life, at this time, hangs in doubt, and there
is no assurance of life, either spiritual or eternal.&nbsp; This
is travailing in spirit, coming to the birth, and no strength to
bring forth.&nbsp; This is tarrying long in the place of the
breaking forth of children; <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>panting, breathing, looking,
thirsting, longing for the knowledge of the pardon of sin, the
clear witness of the Spirit, and the sweet, smiting, kind, loving
approbation of God.&nbsp; Such souls are already pronounced
blessed, and what God has promised he will surely perform.&nbsp;
Such long to come forth; are afraid of peace and comfort, ease
and quietness, lest it should not be God&rsquo;s work; and such
would rather be always in bondage than in carnal ease, or false
peace or confidence.</p>
<p>Beautiful that Promise, <i>Blessed are they that hunger and
thirst after righteousness</i>, <i>for they shall be
filled</i>.&nbsp; Such are represented as waiting upon God.&nbsp;
Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
strength&mdash;and they shall not be ashamed that wait for
me.&nbsp; At the Pool of Bethesda they lay till Jesus
appears&mdash;at the posts of God&rsquo;s Doors they wait till
favour is shewed them&mdash;they are admitted to the Inner Court,
till faith gathers strength enough to believe in the love of God
towards them; and till they can receive into their souls the
Atonement this gives peace to the conscience, and joy in God, and
this honor have all the saints.&nbsp; This is the New Birth,
which you, I trust, know something of experimentally; but
darkness will sometimes hide it from you.&nbsp; I must recommend
you a sweet text in Job.&nbsp; <i>Thine age shall be clearer than
the noon day&mdash;thou shalt shine forth</i>, <i>thou shall be
clear as the morning</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>But
this new-making second Birth, and new Creation, is the joint work
of the adorable Trinity, and is, of course, property ascribed to
each Person, <i>Remember therefore thy new Creators</i>.&nbsp;
Let Israel rejoice in <i>them</i> that made him.&nbsp; God the
Father is called the Father of Christ, the Father of
Lights.&nbsp; Of his own will begat he us, with the Word of
Truth.&nbsp; He sheds the dew of the Spirit upon us abundantly,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; This Work is also attributed
to Jesus; he is the Resurrection and the Life&mdash;he raiseth up
and quickeneth whom he will; and it is by virtue of his
Resurrection from the dead that we are begotten again to a lively
hope.</p>
<p>The blessed and eternal Spirit, the Lord and giver of Life, is
also the Author of this New Creation&mdash;<i>Except a man be
born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven</i>.&nbsp; It is the Spirit that quickens; he it is
prepares the mind for Christ, then testifies of Christ to the
soul.&nbsp; May you, my dear Friend, enjoy much of his testimony,
and set to your seal, that <i>God is true</i>&mdash;and, if I
have not tired your patience, let me remind you of another great
act of your <span class="smcap">Creators</span>, the completing
the Work in a manifestative way, in the glorious Resurrection of
the Body, to enjoy endless felicity with the soul.&nbsp; This is
what we have in lively hope and earnest expectation; for this we
groan&mdash;this is the redemption of the purchased
Possession.&nbsp; God our covenant Father loved our bodies as
well as our <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>souls&mdash;the dear Redeemer bought the one as well as
the other&mdash;he suffered in the body for sins done by the
body.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit graciously takes up his abode in the
soul, as the earnest of the future inheritance.</p>
<p>This Doctrine has been denied by many&mdash;this has been
ridiculed as contrary to sense and reason; but why should it be
thought a thing incredible <i>that God should raise the Dead</i>?
it can easily be accomplished by the infinite power and wisdom of
God, as well as the first formation of it; the one will be as
easy to him as the other&mdash;the sacred scriptures assure us of
it, our faith gives credit to it; and this faith is not in vain,
the Redeemer would lose a part of his purchase if the dead rise
not; besides, he has redeemed them to God, and from the grave;
and the general judgment requires that those who sleep in the
dust should come forth.&nbsp; There is a necessity of the body
rising, else we should lose part of our bliss; for we shall want
some of our members in heaven, as the eye, to see Christ in the
flesh, and one another; and the ear, to hear the everlasting
songs of praise; and the tongue, to sing them.&mdash;Nor is this
contrary to reason; hence the dear Redeemer, and his servant
Paul, has set it forth by the figure of a corn of wheat, which,
being sown, alters, corrupts, and then springs up a very
different figure, yet it is the same corn of wheat that was sown,
though now it appears with a stalk, a blade, and an <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>ear: so our
bodies will be sown; and spring up again with additional
circumstances.&nbsp; Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
first Resurrection.&nbsp; What heart can conceive the joyful
meeting of soul and body again?&nbsp; This is most affectingly
described by Blair:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Nor
shall the conscious soul<br />
Mistake its partner, but amidst the crowd,<br />
Singling its other half, into its arms<br />
Shall rush, with all the impatience of a man<br />
That&rsquo;s new come home, and having long been absent,<br />
With haste runs over every different room,<br />
In pain to see the whole.&nbsp; Thrice happy meeting!<br />
Nor time, nor death shall ever part them more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Resurrection to eternal life, is the joint work of our
glorious <i>Makers</i>.&mdash;<i>Knowing that he which raised up
Jesus from the dead</i>, <i>shall raise us up also by him</i>,
<i>and shall present us with you</i>.&nbsp; So this great act is
ascribed to the dear Saviour; he shall change our vile
bodies.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit will have an hand in this momentous
affair, he shall also quicken our mortal bodies.&nbsp; And it is
a charming thought, my Brother, that as sure as we have been
quickened in the soul we shall be in the body&mdash;certain as we
hear the voice of Jesus in the Gospel, we shall hear it in the
Resurrection, calling us forth to eternal life.&nbsp; And as sure
as the Gospel trumpet proclaims liberty to our souls, the last
trumpets sound shall bring liberty to our bodies.&nbsp; Let this
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>thought
comfort you, nor shall you be ashamed of your hope, for the mouth
of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
<p>It is time I proceed to speak of the third particular, the
Wise Man&rsquo;s exhortation&mdash;<i>Remember</i>.&mdash;We meet
with many such fatherly admonitions in scripture, and in fact,
God promises we shall remember.&nbsp; <i>Thou shalt remember all
the way the Lord thy God hath led thee in the
Wilderness</i>.&mdash;And one of the blessed Offices of the Holy
Ghost is that of a Remembrancer.&nbsp; This influence over the
mind we often need in our state of pilgrimage: we have,
naturally, bad memories&mdash;besides, Satan is a thief, and he
is secretly watching to steal all the good he can from us, and to
leave us all the dregs.&nbsp; Our inbred sins, and many outward
foes, also hurt our memories&mdash;they are Foxes that spoil the
Vines, that have tender grapes.&nbsp; It is an unspeakable mercy
that our Salvation does not depend upon our memories, but in
God&rsquo;s remembering of us.&nbsp; Hence he has said, <i>If I
forget thee</i>, <i>O Jerusalem</i>, <i>let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth</i>.&nbsp; He remembered his Covenant, he
remembered his mercy.&nbsp; <i>I will remember my Covenant with
thee</i>.&nbsp; Then he appeals to parental affections, and asks,
<i>Can a woman forget her sucking child</i>?&nbsp; <i>Yea</i>,
<i>she may forget</i>, (perhaps, my Brother, I am an instance of
it) <i>yet will I not forget thee</i>.&nbsp; <i>My kindness shall
not depart from thee</i>, <i>nor the Covenant of my peace be
removed</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>, <i>that hath mercy on</i> <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span><span
class="GutSmall">THEE</span>, <i>O thou afflicted</i>, <i>tossed
with tempest</i>, <i>and not comforted</i>.&mdash;Here is our
security, though we are so forgetful, so ungrateful&mdash;forever
we dwell in his heart, forever in his mind; and he has graciously
intimated there are some things which he can never do,
consistently with his Nature, his Perfections, and
Covenant.&nbsp; It was impossible for God to lie: he cannot
forget his people, he will not remember their sins; he will never
leave nor forsake those he once has loved.</p>
<p>But we are exhorted to <i>Remember him</i>.&nbsp; This act, in
scripture, signifies to keep in mind somewhat future and
important, that we may notice it when it comes again.&nbsp;
<i>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day</i>: it signifies to
think of, and deeply consider.&nbsp; <i>When I remember thee on
my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches</i>: it
signifies to love and esteem.&nbsp; <i>No man remembered that
same poor man</i>: to praise or mention the great acts of
covenant love, in a way of gratitude.&nbsp; <i>Remember his
marvellous works which he hath done</i>: it signifies to call to
mind.&nbsp; <i>Remember that ye were Gentiles in the flesh</i>:
so that we remember God, when we think of, believe in, and depend
on him for help and strength.&nbsp; <i>Some put their trust in
horses</i>, <i>some in chariots</i>, <i>but we will remember the
Lord our God</i>.&nbsp; To remember, in scripture, also signifies
to make a collection.&nbsp; Hence the Apostle speaking of
christian <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>alms giving, says, <i>That we should remember the
poor</i>; <i>the same which I was always forward to do</i>.&nbsp;
Here, then, clearly appears our privilege, to think deeply of the
great things of God&mdash;often to call them to mind; his
everlasting love, its freeness and power; his everlasting
covenant, that cannot be broken&mdash;his everlasting purposes to
save the ruined, the helpless, and the vile.&nbsp; The
everlasting righteousness of the dear God Man Mediator&mdash;the
everlasting salvation with which all the elect shall be
saved&mdash;the value, the efficacy, and unspeakable worth of the
Atonement&mdash;the preciousness of the offices, glory, titles,
and characters of the adorable Trinity in Unity.&nbsp; These
things must be deeply learnt and kept in mind&mdash;the knowledge
of them will surely do us good in the days of evil.&nbsp; To make
a collection of the good things the Spirit has shewn to
us&mdash;every token for good, every sermon he has blest with
power, every sweet view of Jesus, every precious promise that has
been applied, every ray of comfort, every season of access and
nearness to God, every good word and kind hint he has given us,
every deliverance he has wrought for us, every clear answer to
prayer, whether of things temporal or spiritual.&nbsp; These we
ought to notice, keep in mind, and often think over, with
humility, with gratitude, with joy, with wonder; and ask, with
the humble Ruth, <i>Why have I found grace in thy sight</i>,
<i>that thou shouldest take knowledge of me</i>, <i>seeing I am
but a stranger</i>?</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Remember, with <i>diligence</i>; for as we abound in
faith the Apostle says, We are to abound in all diligence.&nbsp;
The pious Psalmist declares, His heart and spirit made a diligent
search.&nbsp; The woman who had lost her piece of silver, is
said, To sweep the house, and search diligently till she found
it&mdash;and the Lord is sure to bless the diligent remembrance
of himself; take the following texts: <i>The hand of the diligent
maketh rich</i>.&nbsp; <i>The hand of the diligent shall bear
rule</i>.&nbsp; <i>The substance of the diligent man is
precious</i>.&nbsp; <i>The soul of the diligent shall be made
fat</i>.&nbsp; <i>The thought of the diligent tends only to
plenty</i>.&nbsp; <i>He that diligently seeketh good procureth
favour</i>.&mdash;Thus we see what God has promised to the
<i>diligent</i>.&nbsp; Say not this is <i>legal</i>, No!&mdash;I
am exhorting a believer, a quickened soul, one that has light,
life, and love.&nbsp; All spiritual actions, acceptable to God,
must spring from this quarter.&nbsp; Do you attend while you can
to these important things, nor shall you fail of your
reward.&nbsp; Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatever a
man soweth that shall he also reap; and sure I am, every man
shall find this text true in his experience, 2 Cor. ix, 6, <i>He
that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly</i>: <i>He which
soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully</i>.&nbsp; So the
scriptures affirm: I have found it and so shall you.</p>
<p>Thus while you are in health of body, peace of mind, furnished
with the Spirit&rsquo;s influence as a Remembrancer&mdash;do call
to mind, collect together <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and highly esteem these things, in
meditation and prayer, and bless him for what he has done for you
and in you.&nbsp; Turn down those pages in your Bible which you
have found precious.&nbsp; Tell the dear people of God what
Christ has done for you, that they may help you to praise him;
for it is written, <i>They shall come and declare the Work of God
in Zion</i>.&mdash;Nor would you lose any thing by it, should you
keep a Diary of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with you; it would be
blessed to read it over another day, especially in the days of
evil.&nbsp; Hence the exhortation, <i>Set thee up way marks</i>:
<i>set thee up high heaps</i>&mdash;for, being like poor Jacob,
we want reminding of our vows, and of God&rsquo;s goodness.&nbsp;
Hence the command, <i>Arise</i>, <i>go to Bethel</i>, <i>where
thou anointedst the Pillar</i>, <i>and make thee an altar to
God</i>, <i>who appeared for thee when thou fleddest from the
face of Esau</i>.&nbsp; It is well to remember what God has done
for us, it encourages us in prayer and sweet confidence another
day, as may be seen in this good man&rsquo;s History, Genesis
xxxii, when pleading with God for his safety.&nbsp; He
acknowledges past mercies, when he only possessed a staff twenty
years before, and with it came over that very place where he then
stood with two hands!&nbsp; He confesses his utter unworthiness,
and pleads with God upon the ground of his promises he had
applied to him in times pest.&nbsp; Presents his prayer, mixed
with thanksgiving, and obtains an answer.&nbsp; To feel gratitude
is a mercy for it well becomes the just to be thankful.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>I&rsquo;ll speak the honors of thy name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With my last lab&rsquo;ring breath;<br />
And, speechless, clasp thee in my arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My joy in life and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads me to notice the reasons Why Solomon urges this
point; <i>because the evil days and years are coming on</i>,
<i>in which you will truly say</i>, <i>I have no pleasure in
them</i>.&nbsp; And as you have a little pleasure at times, and
have had a good deal of pleasure in the Bible, in the House of
God, at the Table of the Lord, in company with the saints, in
private retirement, in doing good to some, in pitying and in
praying for others, and could understand something of this text,
<i>They meetest him that rejoicest in thee&mdash;those that
remember thee in thy ways</i>.&nbsp; In which things you have had
pleasure, and could rejoice in these youthful days.&nbsp; But as
some of these days are gone, and the rest may fly, let me advise
you against such seasons as you will say, You have no pleasure
in.&nbsp; But may the Lord water you every moment, and keep you
night and day, to final salvation&mdash;maintain his own work,
and bear testimony to your spirit, what is his work, and what is
not.&nbsp; This you have prayed for many a time, and by terrible
things in righteousness God is pleased often to answer us.</p>

40</span><i>LETTER IV</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
AMICUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">HAVE</span> been a little concerned
of late about the term <i>Prophet</i>.&nbsp; You guess what is
the cause: many eminent professors, who are better acquainted
with the News-paper than the Bible, have been lately venting out
a good deal of spite against the memory of a late Minister, in
consequence of what they call his ambitious and
strongly-conceited <i>Epitaph</i>&mdash;&ldquo;A Prophet hath
been among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quite forgetting that <i>all</i>
real, faithful ministers, are entitled to the same name.&nbsp;
The passage is, in part, quoted from Ezekiel ii, 5.&nbsp; <i>And
they</i>, <i>whether they will hear</i>, <i>or whether they well
forbear</i>, <i>for they are a rebellious house</i>, <i>yet shall
know that a Prophet hath been among them</i>.&nbsp; I believe
this name is applied to gospel ministers, nearly twenty times in
the New Testament.&nbsp; Many things of eternal importance do
they prophecy; and one branch of their prophecy I am sure you
will find true, <i>viz.</i>&nbsp; That through much tribulation,
they <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>must
enter the kingdom.&mdash;Jacob called his sons together and said,
<i>I will tell you that which shall befal you in the latter
days</i>.&nbsp; And Solomon, the type of our most blessed
Immanuel, acting in this character, gives intimation, of what
<i>we</i> must experience, that are created anew in Christ Jesus,
and predestinated to the possession and enjoyment of the good
work of Jesus&mdash;the good work of the eternal Spirit, and the
good work and enjoyment of the blessed in Heaven.&nbsp; These God
has ordained we should walk in&mdash;these are the evidences of
union to Jesus; and as these are our privileges, so we must
indeed drink of the same Cup Jesus did, and be immersed in the
same Baptism.&nbsp; This was what the Holy Spirit witnessed to
Paul, that in every city where he came bonds and affliction
should await him, and he must go through them.&nbsp; No doubt
these will have a glorious tendency, for our Covenant God does
nothing in vain.&nbsp; You have hitherto been much indulged; I
have really envied you, but the change you now experience is only
to shew you what need you have of the <i>whole</i> armour of
God.&nbsp; You are but just come into the field of action, to
combat with sin, Satan, errors, hypocrites, and erroneous
men&mdash;to combat with many outward and inward foes, who now
appear to your view.</p>
<p>But the dear Saviour will also appear very precious now, in
other forms, to what you have <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>ever felt of seen him.&nbsp; The
Spirit will take every opportunity to reveal him just as you
really need him.&nbsp; You will so learn Christ that you will be
able to stand in these days of evil, which must come on the
followers of the dear Saviour, and in which they must say they
feel no pleasure.&nbsp; These evil days are set forth by Solomon
under the following metaphors: The darkness of the sun, the moon,
and stars, with a long, heavy, lowering sky.&nbsp; These things
will be understood by the tried family of God; so that while you
have the season of getting, or doing good, you must use that
period for that use&mdash;hence such seasons are called an
<i>Hour</i>&mdash;very short, but precisely fixed and determined
by our covenant God.&nbsp; This season is called a <i>Day</i>
that will soon go away, and the <i>Night</i> commence.&nbsp; This
day is far spent with you, and a night is come on, in which you
cannot work, but must wait&mdash;in which you cannot run, but
must stand still, till the Lord sends you bright clouds, and a
clear shining after rain.&nbsp; This season, in your experience,
is called a <i>Morning</i>.&nbsp; How lovely and pleasant, while
through the falling dew of God&rsquo;s favor, your graces budded,
and the softly-pleasing southern gales caused your spikenard to
send forth a delightful perfume.&nbsp; But evil days must come;
not such evil days as must befal those as have no interest in, or
love to the Saviour, and which may never come on in <i>this</i>
world.&nbsp; Hence they are said to receive their good things in
this life, but the righteous evil things.&nbsp; <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>What a mercy,
my brother! in all that befals you there is no curse, no hatred
in God to you, no unatoned guilt, no danger of hell, or of coming
short of the desired haven; nor perhaps <i>many</i> fears or
dread of <i>these</i> things: I hope they are gone out of your
conscience long ago: not but you may be tempted about them for a
time, but these shall be gone.&nbsp; Hence God promises, that on
all hills which shall be digged with a mattock there shall not
come thither the fears of briars and thorns; the real cause of
these fears never shall come on you again.&nbsp; But the design
of this Letter is simply to point out some of the evil
days.&nbsp; Literally, Solomon refers to old age, with all the
infinities that attend it.&nbsp; And this may be applied to the
weakness of the human frame, the trouble, as well as to longevity
of life; and hence the 71st Psalm, composed by David, and indited
by the Spirit, which belongs to Christ.&nbsp; He, the adorable
Messiah, prays, <i>Cast me not off in the time of old age</i>,
which is explained in the next clause, <i>when my strength
faileth me</i>; and is doubtless the meaning of the 18th
verse.&nbsp; This may be seen in his agony in the garden, when he
cried out, <i>O my Father</i>! <i>if it be possible let this cup
pass from me</i>.&nbsp; Now likewise his prayer was answered, for
there appeared an angel from heaven to him to strengthen
him.&nbsp; Thus age is not always applied to length of years; a
person through affliction of body, many cares, crosses and
losses, may <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>be old; that is, as weak in constitution as the most
aged and infirm character.&nbsp; No doubt many bear up amazingly
well under the infirmities of age; but it must be allowed these
are evil days: <i>that</i> alone which can sweeten them, is a
good hope through grace, the clear witness of the Spirit of God
to the conscience, a lively precious faith in an everlasting
covenant, in the blood of the Lamb, and in the faithfulness of
that God who has graciously said, <i>and even to old age and
hoary hairs will I be with you</i>.&nbsp; Justified in the
Redeemer&rsquo;s obedience, and kept firm in the truth.&nbsp;
Solomon says, <i>The hoary head is a crown of glory if it be
found in the way of righteousness</i>.&nbsp; Happy, thrice happy
old man! just upon the threshold of that joy that awaits
thee.&nbsp; Soon thy spiritual Joseph will send the waggons of
his holy angels to conduct thee to himself, to behold all his
glory.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet a season and you know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy entrance shall be given&mdash;<br />
All your sorrows left below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And earth exchang&rsquo;d for heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a prospect! what a scene! what a joy! nor shall you be
disappointed of your hope, seeing Christ is commissioned to keep
what you have long committed to his dear divine hands, your body
and soul, the one for almost immediate glory, the other for a
joyful resurrection.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Thus
having viewed the passage in this literal form, let me return to
point out some of the days of evil of which the Bible speaks, and
you may meet with, that when they come you may remember I told
you of them.&nbsp; When God is pleased to shew us our sinful
hearts in that degree we are able to bear it.&nbsp; When
conscience reproaches us for sins of omission and commission;
sins long practised and long pursued by us.&nbsp; Satan taking
the advantage of these convictions, and throwing in his fiery
darts.&nbsp; These are called the days of evil.&nbsp;
<i>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil</i>, <i>when the
iniquity of my heels shall compass me about</i>.&nbsp; This is a
time you will surely meet with, as Job and others have, who have
said before you, <i>Thou makest me to possess the iniquities of
my youth</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thou hast set my secret sins before
me</i>.&nbsp; <i>Remember not the sins of my youth</i>.&nbsp;
Such days as these, when guilt lies heavy on the conscience, you
will feel no pleasure, till faith embraces the atonement, and
banishes fear.&nbsp; Another evil day you will have is the day of
temptation, when Satan is apparently let loose upon you, as he
was upon poor Job, and Paul, and Jeremiah.&nbsp; When you will
want your head covered in the day of battle, and feel your need
of the shield of faith and the helmet of hope, the one to cover
your head, the other to repel these fiery darts of the Devil,
which he will shoot at you&mdash;fiery shot, from the burning
malice of Hell, such as strong temptation to excite burning
lusts, blasphemous thoughts of <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>God, horrid suggestions, debasing
thoughts of Christ, with all the Atheism, Deism, Arianism,
Socinianism, Arminianism, and Antinomianism of the human heart,
stirred up by the Devil, to foster despair, enmity, and hatred of
God.&nbsp; Thus tried you must watch the motions of the Spirit,
leading you to the death of the Saviour, and with your Spirit
exclaiming, Thou, O Lord, art my hope in the day of evil.</p>
<p>I must notice another day: <i>Public troubles on the
Church</i>, which I believe will come yet; I humbly conceive the
man of sin will die hard; he seems to be hearing some of his
dying groans at present, but it will have its last convulsive
struggle; the hour of temptation must come on&mdash;the Church
seems in her Laodicean state, and it may be really in that state
for all I know, though many great men suppose the Church in her
Sardian state; be that as it may, have we not cause to lament the
general drowsiness of the Church, the very few names that have
not defiled their garments&mdash;the cloudy state of Professor
and Possessor&mdash;the state the Prophet alluded to, when he
said, <i>It shall come to pass that the light shall not be clear
nor dark</i>.&nbsp; Is it not true of that light which is in the
Church? the people not wholly in the dark about the Doctrines of
the Gospel, yet they are not clear; and perhaps, never was a time
in the Church when God&rsquo;s real people were so cloudy,
generally, about their <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>interest in the Saviour, so that we
may look for the sieve&mdash;a sifting time will come, for the
Church and the World seem too much allied, at present, in
principle and practice.&nbsp; The Saviour says, <i>Be ye
seperate</i>&mdash;and if this small, still voice is not obeyed,
you may depend upon it he will bring his rod, <i>for his fan is
in his hand</i>, <i>and he will thoroughly purge his
floor</i>.&nbsp; Hence his own declaration, <i>And I will bring
upon thee a day of evil</i>.&nbsp; This you may feel
personally.&nbsp; Also, after having been a little at ease, and
careless of God&rsquo;s glory, his cause, and his ways, he may
permit you to fall; or by associating with carnal Professors, or
the World too much, God may bring on you a rod to drive you from
them&mdash;and if you should chance to fall, and they know it,
though God in mercy, gives you repentance to life, they will be
the first to stone you, and like the Priest and Levite, take care
to avoid you; and if after this, you maintain the sentiment of
human weakness, and insist upon it man is nothing, but as he is
made and kept by the grace of God, these stout men, these
whole-hearted professors, will hate you and your Doctrines; so
Job found, when he said, <i>He that is ready to slip with his
feet</i>, <i>is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is
at ease</i>.&nbsp; But God may bring on you such an evil day.</p>
<p>Another day of evil is, <i>Suffering persecution from the
world for the truth&rsquo;s sake</i>; or from those who profess a
part of the truth.&nbsp; Such may hate <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>you, nay the Saviour says they
<i>shall</i> hate you, and say all manner of evil against
you&mdash;<i>all manner</i>, not a few hard and ill-natured
things, but any thing disrespectful, spiteful, and
disgraceful.&nbsp; This may be the lot of my Brother&mdash;this
you will find very hard, seeing you have been kind to all, and
acted as upright before men as you could, never deserving this
from man,&mdash;yet meeting with it.&nbsp; Defamation of
character, endeavouring to injure you in your situation, trying
to prejudice all your friends against you, and to stir up your
own household to oppose you.&nbsp; But these things <i>will</i>
they do to you, because, says the Saviour, <i>They have not known
the Father nor me</i>.&nbsp; However, you will not be wholly
destitute of some who will be raised up for your good.&nbsp;
Hence the promise to the persecuted saint, <i>And I will cause
you to be well entreated in the day of evil</i>.&nbsp; This was
God&rsquo;s promise to poor Jeremiah; and the Saviour gives the
command, <i>Let my out-casts dwell with thee</i>, <i>Moab</i>,
<i>be thou a covert to him</i>, <i>from the face of the
spoiler</i>.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord will take care of you in time of persecution,
national troubles, which the children of God must feel in their
degree, through the loss of trade, bankruptcies, a long war, the
high price of provisions, and the scarcity of every national
blessing; yet, depend upon it, the Lord will find bread for
you.&nbsp; So David encourages the people of God, <i>I have been
young and now am old</i>, <i>yet I never saw </i><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span><i>the
righteous forsaken nor his seed begging of bread</i>.&nbsp; Or,
as the learned say, it should be rendered, <i>though</i> begging
of bread, <i>yet</i> not forsaken.&nbsp; Bread and water the Lord
has promised you, and remembering that you are one of his
prisoners, that he is bound to maintain <i>you</i>, Friends will
be raised up, a supply will be sent in from the most unlikely
quarters.&nbsp; <i>And the earth helped the woman.&mdash;I have
commanded the Ravens to feed thee there</i>.&nbsp; Thus you shall
not want in the day of evil.&nbsp; You may meet with many family
troubles as Jacob did, and say with that dear Patriarch, at the
close of your life, <i>Few and evil have the days of my life
been</i>.&nbsp; Many evils have I met with from my children and
relations, enough to break a heart of stone.&nbsp; My relations
were envious, oppressive, cruel, and ungrateful.&nbsp; My
children&rsquo;s conduct often pierced my heart.&mdash;I have
been in many wants and dangers, but the Lord that redeemed me
from all evil, has thus far led me on, and I am now going home,
for I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.</p>
<p>Thus my dear Brother, you may have some days of evil, from
family troubles, losses, crosses, and cares.&nbsp; You may have
no small opposition from men of corrupt minds, that lay in wait
to deceive.&nbsp; Hence the Apostle recommends a clear
experimental knowledge of the truth&mdash;Christ the essential
truth, and the word of God as the revealed truth.&nbsp; A few
head notions though very clear, are not able to withstand <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the artifices
of hell, for if a man is argued into a set of notions, he is
liable to be argued out of them.&nbsp; When a man of ability,
reason, sense, and a vast string of arguments, against the
previous truths of the gospel, attacks such as have no grace in
the heart, they are soon moved from the truth; but when those are
attacked that have felt the precious truths of the gospel in the
heart, though the poor believer is not able to answer him one
question out of an hundred, he can prove the reality of those
truths he holds, because they have done so much for him.&nbsp;
The truth has brought him from darkness to light, from sin to
holiness, from the service of the devil to the Service of
God.&nbsp; Thus He can prove the reality of Bible truth, by his
own present experience; and thus he is able to stand in the evil
day, the day of rebuke and blasphemy.&nbsp; I can prove the
Divinity of God my Saviour; by the answers he has given me to
prayer, by the words he has sent to my heart, with power, and by
the virtue of his sacrifice, which has lifted up my mind, so as
no human power or object could have done, I can likewise prove
the Doctrine of the Trinity, by the operation of the
Father&rsquo;s love, the manifestation of the Atonement of the
Son, and by the regenerating influences of the Spirit.&nbsp; So
we can experimentally prove the truth of every doctrine and
divine ordinance.&nbsp; But then, when all my former experience
is hid from me; what am I to do, when attacked by my foes in this
evil day, and I am <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>as a dumb man, in whose mouth are no reproofs?&nbsp; How
shall I act? methinks you are ready to say.&nbsp; To which I must
reply, that there is a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
but if shut up in heart and lip, then stand still, and hence the
watch word, <i>Stand</i>! <i>stand</i>! <i>shall they cry</i>,
<i>but none shall look back&mdash;still abide by the stuff</i>,
<i>if you are not able to go out to battle</i>, <i>you shall
share alike with those that do</i>.&nbsp; <i>Having done all to
stand</i>, <i>stand in the evil day</i>.&nbsp; Still go on
hearing, praying, reading, hoping, and waiting, and whatever
errors are thrown into your mind, and have brought it into
bondage, you may depend upon it the Lord will deliver you from
them; and here you will see sovereign grace, yourself delivered,
and the wise and prudent given up to believe a lie.&nbsp; This
made the redeemer glad; he rejoiced in spirit and said, <i>I
thank thee</i>, <i>Father</i>, <i>Lord of heaven and earth</i>,
<i>that thou hast</i> <span class="GutSmall">HID</span> <i>these
things from the wise and prudent</i>, <i>and hast revealed them
unto babes&mdash;even so Father</i>, <i>for so it seemeth good in
thy sight</i>.&mdash;Thus may you stand in the days of evil.</p>
<p>But finally; sickness, age, death, and judgment, are days of
evil; not that there can be any curse in these things, to one of
God&rsquo;s elect, but they will be found such to those who know
not God.&mdash;These are days in which none but the favourites of
Christ can lift up their heads: <i>the prudent man foreseeth the
evil</i>, <i>and hideth himself</i>, <i>but the simple </i><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span><i>pass on
and are punished</i>.&nbsp; But in times of sickness and age, the
brightest saint may suffer much in body, and be afflicted in
mind: God may hide his face, Satan may plague, conscience may be
uneasy; pain may be great, the spirits may droop; but there is no
curse in all these things: one smile from the Saviour will clear
all up, and make the soul happy in a sickly body.&nbsp; Hence the
promise, <i>blessed is he that considereth the poor and
needy</i>; even a precious Jesus in his personal or mystical
suffering, the Lord will make his bed in his sickness.&nbsp; This
my dear brother is acting the part of a kind nurse, he will
strengthen you upon the bed of languishing: thus shall my subject
be felt in times of sickness and age, even the peculiar
blessedness of considering, of remembering our Creator in the
days of youth.&nbsp; Death and judgment will be evil times to
many of our fallen race, but they must be the crowning days of
all who love <i>his</i> appearing.&nbsp; But I must not enlarge,
I think I shall tire your patience in this long letter; the sheep
are gathering together, I must ran with some food for
them&mdash;&rsquo;tis past seven o&rsquo;Clock; God bless
thee.</p>
<p>Ever your&rsquo;s in him who is our hiding place, and our
shield,</p>

53</span><i>LETTER V</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
THEOPHILUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I well remember some conversation which we once had upon the
subject of the creation, and feeling my mind particularly imprest
with that subject, I venture only to drop a word or two upon it,
&rsquo;tis a mercy to be satisfied with what God has said; but
some are daringly presumptuous, so that they can treat both the
Deity and his revelation with contempt.&nbsp; I am glad you are
delivered from that snare.&nbsp; The Mosaic account of the
Creation has always been supposed to be too weak, simple, and
incorrect for a philosophic mind; they vainly suppose the mind
ought to have been led through the whole Planetary System,
instead of being led to the glorious Work of Redemption, which
reflects his highest honour and beauty; for here, and here alone,
his brightest form of glory shines.</p>
<p>The six days work of Creation was to open to the eye of faith
his works very gradually, that like the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>stars of a
night, they might be seen one by one.&nbsp; The six days work,
and the seventh day of rest, was no doubt designed to shadow
forth the Seven Millenniums, which would include all time between
the two eternities.&nbsp; The first day, from Adam to Enoch, had
in it a revelation of the true light&mdash;the second, from Enoch
to Abraham, including the division of the waters&mdash;the third
day, from Abraham to David, including the separation of the
nations of the world&mdash;the fourth day, represented the
Thousand Years from Solomon to Christ, the time when the Shekinah
appeared in the Temple: the Church, fair as the Moon, and the
Prophets, the Stars, shone bright in the firmament.&nbsp; At the
close of this, Christ the true Sun appeared.&nbsp; The fifth day
was to point out the state of the church and the world, from
Christ to the Reformation, when the great Whales of
Anti-christian powers, troubled the seas.&nbsp; This lasted till
the glorious Reformation, the beginning of the Sixth Day, in
which we now are, and longing for the Seventh, the rest of Jesus
and his Bride, in the den of Eden, the glorious Millennium.&nbsp;
But infidels object to the Mosaic account of light, the finest
emblem of Jesus&mdash;there is nothing in the account contrary
either to reason or philosophy.&nbsp; I acknowledge the question
which philosophers have asked, cannot be solved, the Bible has
not engaged to satisfy vain curiosity, viz. <i>What was that
light that made its appearance before the Sun</i>?&nbsp; A very
learned man supposes it to have been an emanation of the same <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Sun that
enlightens us, and which was created though it had not yet
appeared in his glory, yet it shed sufficient light to make the
Globe visible.&mdash;This is not a bad idea for a half-hearted
Christian Philosopher.&mdash;Milton seems to lean this way when
speaking of light&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To journey through the aerial gloom began,<br />
Sphered in a radient cloud, for yet the Sun<br />
Was not, she in a cloudy tabernacle<br />
Sojourn&rsquo;d the while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very pretty idea, nor is it at all contrary to
reason any more than the cloud that followed the Israelites which
contained a shade, a fire, darkness, and light at the same
time.&nbsp; Yet the word of God is true, and to that we must
adhere.&nbsp; As light without the sun was first formed, so it
appears the great Creator collected these particles of light into
one body, the Sun.&nbsp; The language of scripture often
expresses the appearance of things to us, such as the Sun rising
and setting, which at the same time, perfectly in the main point,
agreeing with the Newtonian System of Philosophy.&nbsp; Did light
appear first? was it not to notice the dispensation for the four
first thousand years, till on the fourth day the Sun of
Righteousness should appear?&nbsp; Was it not an emblem of all
the light the Church of God has now, till the second appearance
of the Son of God in our nature, and of that light which we have
till <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the
Saviour shines upon the soul, with healing in his beams?&nbsp; We
have light to see ourselves and his glory, but we want him to
shine with power, then we shall <i>be light in the Lord</i>, till
then, light and darkness must struggle together; and God divided
them, to shew the difference between the Law and the
Gospel&mdash;between the Flesh and the Spirit, between the Church
and the World&mdash;between the Elect and the
Reprobate&mdash;Christ and Anti-christ.&nbsp; See the light and
darkness struggling; see it soon begins in Cain and Abel, and to
this day it continues, and will for ever.&nbsp; The Elect and
Reprobate are divided in election, in redemption, in calling, in
principles, in practices, in death, judgment, and eternity.&nbsp;
May this subject lead you and me to the Saviour, who is the
light, the beauty, purity, loveliness, and glory of the
Church.&nbsp; O may we see him, love him, adore him, and enjoy
him, till we behold him in Heaven.</p>
<p>Permit me to notice further, that the Holy Ghost is pleased to
represent various characters and things by these same terms, Sun,
Moon, Light, and Stars,&mdash;which is really worthy our
attention.&nbsp; He sets forth the Lord Jesus by that well known
emblem, the Sun, and I think it is the finest figure in nature;
and hence that very precious promise to those who are the called
according to his purpose, <i>Unto you that fear my name shall the
Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his beams</i>.&nbsp;
Eternal sun, whose morning measures all our days, who hast
gradually <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>risen on my dear friend&rsquo;s heart, shine brighter to
perfect day, even to that blessed meridian when in our flesh we
shall see God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the moon, in scripture, signifies the Church of God
as inferior to Christ, the glorious sun, from whom they borrow
all their light and truth; their frames and feelings inconstant,
spotted in their hearts and lives, which is the cause of much
grief to their souls, yet they are the light of this lower world,
and their influence is great on the sea of this troubled
state.</p>
<p>Light is sometimes used as an emblem of God&rsquo;s word, as
pure, glorious, pleasant, and comfortable, penetrating and
purifying.&nbsp; While favored with this light, may we walk in
it, lest darkness overtake us, as it is written, <i>Give glory to
the Lord your God</i>, <i>before he cause darkness</i>.&mdash;By
Stars, in scripture, sometimes the Spirit condescends to point
out the Ministers of the Gospel, with all the Ordinances, which
are designed, like the Star in the East, to lead to the grand
end, the Babe of Bethlehem.&nbsp; These are fixed in the
firmament of the Church, for adorning it, and for guiding the
spiritual mariner to endless glory, amidst the nights of trouble
and woe.&nbsp; These are held in the hands of Christ, kept,
supported, and blest by him; and though constantly opposed and
troubled, yet shine <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>on, and shine forth.&nbsp; This is the mystery of the
Seven Stars.&nbsp; But these are likewise used to point out other
things in sacred writ.&nbsp; When God foretold the exaltation of
Joseph, in a dream, he shewed him, in a second revelation, the
sun, moon, and eleven stars, bowing down to him; which was
afterwards explained by the venerable Patriarch finding an asylum
with his son Joseph, and his brethren doing him homage in his
state of exaltation.&mdash;And was it not a striking type of our
truly-exalted spiritual Joseph? honored by the most dignified
characters in our world, for kings shall submit themselves to
him, and the whole Church of Jesus, the moon, with all the stars,
ministers of the Gospel, that should bow before him, and Crown
him Lord of all.</p>
<p>I remark again, that when the Saviour predicted the overthrow
of Jerusalem, he foretold that the sun should be darkened, that
is, that the Lord, who was the light of the Jewish Church, should
withdraw his light, justly leave them in judicial blindness, in
which they remain to this day&mdash;that the moon should be
turned into blood, that is, their Synagogue, their Church, which
was put to the sword, (at least the greatest part of
them)&mdash;that the stars should fall&mdash;their doctors,
rulers over the church and state&mdash;which they did.&nbsp; But
Solomon, in his 12th of Ecclesiastes, verse 2, seems to borrow
these metaphors of sun, moon, light, and stars, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>and applies
them to the human frame, when sickness or old age has impaired
it.&nbsp; Good Mr. Henry remarks on this passage&mdash;the decays
and infirmities of old age are here elegantly set forth in
figurative expressions, which have some difficulty in them to us
now, who are not acquainted with the phrases and metaphors used
in Solomon&rsquo;s age and language.&nbsp; But the general scope
is plain, to shew how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old
age are.&nbsp; Then he proceeds, and says, that the sun, moon,
stars, and light will be dim to old people, through the decay of
their sight; their countenance is decayed, and the beauty and
lustre of it is eclipsed&mdash;their intellectual powers and
faculties, which are as light in the soul, are
weakened&mdash;their understanding and memory fail them, and
their apprehension is not so quick, nor their fancy so lively as
it has been.&mdash;Light is often put for joy and
prosperity&mdash;the days of their mirth are over, and they have
not the pleasure either of the converse by day, or the repose of
night, for both the sun and moon was darkened to them; then the
clouds return after the rain, as when the weather is disposed to
wet, no sooner is one shower blown over but another succeeds it,
when one pain is a little abated another comes on&mdash;the gout,
the rheumatism; and so these afflictions being common to aged
persons, they are continually grieved.</p>
<p>That famous commentator, Patrick, observes on <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>this verse,
that the words intimate the universal decay of the whole frame of
nature, and a failing of the mind in all its faculties and
powers&mdash;that something particular is signified by every
word; that by the sun is meant the soul itself; by the light the
understanding, by the moon his will, by the stars all the motion
of the mind and memory, with all the affections and powers in the
will.&nbsp; So the sense of the wise man is thus&mdash;the mind
of man grows feeble in all its powers, the understanding
dim-sighted, the memory forgetful, the reason weak and childish,
giving even a feeble light, that can neither direct ourselves or
others.&nbsp; The will listless in all its desires, dull about
our greatest concerns, wavering and inconstant in all
resolutions, and so on.&nbsp; But the interpretation first
mentioned seems most consistent.</p>
<p>Surely then, my Brother, these are some of the evil days which
are hastening on us, and though we may not live to see old age,
yet, through affliction we may have all our faculties as much
impaired as the most ancient person in the world; this has been
very often seen.&mdash;What a mercy I do consider it, that
<i>he</i> who hath begun the good work in my heart, can carry it
on without my aid, or the concurrence of my powers or faculties
working with him.&nbsp; Say not it is my duty to do so and so, in
and with the work of the Spirit: <i>Thou</i>, <i>Lord</i>, says
the Church, <i>shall work all our works </i><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span><i>in us</i>,
<i>and ordain peace for us</i>.&nbsp; But while we would look
forward to the evil days which must come on the body, may we not
notice some evil days that our souls may meet with, when the
all-healing, comfortable, soul-reviving, soul-cheering,
heart-warming beams of Christ, the glorious Sun of Righteousness
shall be with-held, and coldness, deadness, sickness, darkness,
legality, and distance is felt; and such seasons have befel the
brightest saints.&nbsp; Hence the mournful cry, <i>Why hidest
thou thy face</i>, <i>O Lord</i>? <i>thou hidest thy face and we
are troubled</i>, about our state, our feelings, our wants, our
prospects, our way, our end.&nbsp; We always know when we feel
him shine and when we do not, though, as it respects himself, he
is just the same in his shining, but we are not sensible of it by
reason of the cloud that cometh betwixt.&nbsp; When we feel this
wretched state we are always ready to fly to means, though we
ought never to neglect them; yet there is a proneness in us to
cleave to something short of the main subject.&nbsp; But, alas,
we find the moon of Ordinances is just as dark!&nbsp; We move
backwards and forwards, like the door on its hinges, yet get
neither dew nor rain, light, life, comfort, nor joy.&nbsp; At the
table of the Lord we neither feel love nor pity for our dear
Saviour.&nbsp; In singing his praises we have no heart, in
associating with his people we get nothing from them; if they
talk of joys, we have none! if of a broken-heart, we feel nothing
but hardness&mdash;if of light or comfort, we <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>feel
destitute of both&mdash;thus the moon gives no light.&nbsp; As to
ministers, they don&rsquo;t seem to touch our case, nor is their
word cloathed with any power.&nbsp; We fancy they are very much
altered in their preaching&mdash;we change them: the passions are
stirred up for a little while, but we find we are in just the
same state.&nbsp; Hence the spouse is represented as having lost
her lover&mdash;she rises, runs, seeks, mourns, and is still
disappointed.&nbsp; <i>I sought him but I found him
not</i>.&nbsp; Then she went into the broad places of public
worship, then into the streets, among the inhabitants; after this
to ministers, to enquire, <i>how</i>? <i>why</i>? and
<i>wherefore</i>?&nbsp; But, for a season, all was still dark,
yes, very dark indeed: these stars seem to give but little light
during such painful seasons: the scriptures of light shut up in
their beautiful histories, promises, types, parables, and
doctrines, where we could see Christ once in every part, and
enjoy him; now, alas, it is not so, but it is as a spring shut
up, and sealed from us.&nbsp; While this is attended with a
lowering sky, and a continual dropping of rain; no bright clouds
now return as they used to do, and how it is with us we cannot
tell.&nbsp; Once if we felt a little dark or uncomfortable, it
was soon gone, smiling hope used to spring up, or a promise sent
home with power.&nbsp; The company of God&rsquo;s people cheered
us up, or a little access to God&rsquo;s throne revived us.&nbsp;
Seldom heard a sermon but we got something by it&mdash;and if a
few storms of persecution, temptation or corruption, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>or family
trials befel us, the Lord made a bright cloud after it; but,
alas, it is not thus with us now, these clouds don&rsquo;t return
after the rain&mdash;thus</p>
<blockquote><p>Afflictions like vapours may rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Light, love, and delight may be gone;<br />
The sun may be dark in the skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hell with its legions come on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, my dear Brother, these are dark days truly, but it shall
not be always thus; <i>to the upright there arises light in
darkness</i>&mdash;this light is sown for us, and shall spring up
again.</p>
<p>But may I not here enquire, as on another occasion, the
Prophet did, <i>Shall there be an evil in the City and the Lord
hath not done it</i>?&nbsp; <i>Is there not a cause</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Why doth a living man</i> (a quickened man)
<i>complain</i>?&nbsp; Let us enquire the cause: Have you not
been making too much of your comforts?&nbsp; Have you not been
looking at them instead of the Saviour, living on them instead of
his fulness?&mdash;and were you not too prone to slight those who
had not attained the same consolation?&nbsp; And, if so, Can you
wonder that God should permit a partial death to overtake
you?&mdash;Or, perhaps, there may be other causes&mdash;a sad
neglect of those means which are appointed for the spiritual
health of the soul: as abstinence, or neglect of food, will soon
bring the body into a pining, languishing condition, so, if the
means of the knowledge of grace <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>be not diligently attended to and
implored, our souls must get into a starving state.&nbsp; The
indulgence of sensual pleasures may bring on deadness, darkness,
and distance.&nbsp; See this in Sampson, while sleeping in the
lap of Delilah, he was shorn of his strength; and he arose to
shake himself as at other times, but he wist not that the Lord
had departed from him.&nbsp; But perhaps the Lord has done this
to shew his adorable sovereignty, as in the case of Job: hence
his complaint, <i>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot
pass</i>, <i>and he hath set darkness in my path</i>.&nbsp; And
so complains Jeremiah, <i>He hath led me</i>, <i>and brought me
into darkness</i>, <i>and not into light</i>.&nbsp; Sometimes
this is done to humble us, lest we should be exalted above
measure.&nbsp; But, above all, the Spirit leads into these deep
and painful feelings, to make us prize our adorable Redeemer, and
see our continual need of being supplied from his fulness.&nbsp;
He lets our cisterns run dry, that we may come and lay our
vessels under the flowings of the blessed fountain of life, that
from him we might receive grace for grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">May great grace rest on you.&nbsp; I
remain<br />
Your willing Servant in Christ,</p>

<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span><i>LETTER VI</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO
THEOPHILUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall"><i>DEAR BROTHER</i></span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">OWE</span> you a long epistle, for
the many kind letters I have received from you.&nbsp; This
acknowledgment of my debt is a part of payment.&nbsp; Being a
little confined through indisposition of body, I thought I would
pen a few thoughts to my dear friend, trusting they will be
acceptable at this time.</p>
<p>I am more than ever delighted with the pleasing theme the
Gospel exhibits of our most adorable Lord, of whom it is written,
<i>that in all our afflictions he was afflicted</i>; <i>that he
was the subject of all sinless infirmities</i>; <i>that he was a
man like ourselves</i>, <i>sin only excepted</i>.&nbsp; This is a
sweet thought to me, under every pressure; and surely it proves
our union with him, and a participation of his Spirit, of course
of the same covenant privileges.&nbsp; What a Christ have we
got!&nbsp; God with God, Man with Man, very God and very Man; a
kind brother, to feel with and for me, under all my trials, and a
God able to supply my every need; and what adds a <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>glory to this
point is, that as God-Man he is the glorious Mediator,
commissioned to give all I need; for this purpose he hath
ascended upon high and received gifts for the rebellions!&nbsp;
This is a most charming consideration, it is the joy of my heart;
I feel it so&mdash;and such an High Priest became us: O! for an
heart to bless him, to praise him as I ought, as I wish to
do!&nbsp; I long to be disembodied for this purpose.&nbsp; O
could my soul leap out of her dull clay, scarce should a harp
above aim at a sweeter, nobler song, <i>Unto him that hath loved
me</i>.&nbsp; My dear brother, I feel mortality, I am at times
very glad of it: I have had much sickness of late, it is a
signal, it is a knock, it is a servant sent with a message.&nbsp;
Mark the command, <i>Look</i>, <i>as when the messenger
cometh</i>, <i>and shut to the door</i>: <i>is not the sound of
his master&rsquo;s feet behind him</i>?&nbsp; I keep the
messenger; I retire; I read the note, Thus saith my Master,
<i>Behold I come quickly</i>; I can send no answer back but
thus&mdash;<i>Even so come</i>, <i>Lord Jesus</i>.&nbsp; May I
therefore esteem every pain, every felt weakness, and every
beating pulse, but as so many messengers sent in covenant love,
to remind me of my mortality&mdash;that this is not my rest, that
my whole bodily frame is but as a Shepherd&rsquo;s tent, as
Hezekiah calls it, soon unpinned, easily taken down, and removed,
as the Arabian Shepherd&rsquo;s tents were.&mdash;Hence the
scriptures in a variety of places shew that the body is but
earth, dust and ashes, formed of it, lives on it, and must soon
return to it.&nbsp; <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>The apostle calls the body an outward man, which must
decay, while the inward man, the hidden man of the heart, is
renewed day by day, by the secret influences of the Spirit.&nbsp;
This work is carried on by a continual application of Gospel
promises, and tokens of love: this inward man gets renewed day by
day, till we arrive to perfect day.&nbsp; This is going from
strength to strength, and being changed from glory to
glory.&nbsp; This body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, the
object of God&rsquo;s Love, and the purchase of the precious
blood of Jesus.&nbsp; This frame is called by Solomon, an house,
built up in infinite wisdom, supported by Almighty power, and is
the noblest workmanship of Jehovah.&nbsp; Compared to an house,
the understanding faculty is the windows, the receptive capacity
is the door; and as the soul is converted to God, the will and
the affections is the throne, the principal seat of Jesus; the
graces of the Spirit is the furniture, and Father, Son, and
Spirit, are the glorious and ever blessed inhabitants thereof,
where they will dwell for ever.&nbsp; The Body, only, I am about
to notice.</p>
<p>I acknowledge I am not much skilled in Anatomy, it is a
science I never learned, though I believe the best Anatomist is a
person who can dissect the human heart.&nbsp; Yet the body being
the great work of God, I would view it with wonder, with
admiration, and praise.&nbsp; I dare say you are sometimes amazed
at this wonderful, curious-wrought frame; <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>this
wonderful display of divine skill.&nbsp; Permit me just to notice
only a very few things, though you are so well acquainted with
anatomy.&nbsp; I trust you will correct me where I err, in
considering this earthly house of our tabernacle.&nbsp; I must
refer you to the excellent Hervey&rsquo;s description of the
human frame, in his 12th Dialogue of Theron and Aspasio, which I
beg you to read: that excellent author observes, first, the
<i>Bones</i>, cast into a variety of moulds, enlarged or
contracted into a variety of sizes, all strong, that they may
bear up the fleshy machine, yet light, that they may not depress
the animal with an encumbering load.&nbsp; Insensible themselves,
they are covered with a membrane of exquisite sensibility.&nbsp;
The <i>Feet</i> compose the firmest and neatest pedestal, capable
of altering its form and extending its size, containing a set of
the nicest springs, which help to place the body in a variety of
graceful attitudes; the <i>Legs</i> and <i>Thighs</i> are like
substantial and stately columns, forced in such a manner as is
quite commodious to the acts of either walking or sitting.&nbsp;
The <i>Ribs</i> turned into a regular arch, are gently moveable
for the act of respiration; they form a secure lodgment for the
lungs and the heart, and fortify them.&nbsp; The back bone is
intended, not only to strengthen the body, and sustain its most
capacious store rooms, but also to bring down that communication
of the Brain, which is usually termed the Spinal Marrow, and
guards the silver cord.&nbsp; The <i>Arms</i> are exactly
proportioned to each other; these being the guards which <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>defend, and
the ministers which serve the whole body, are fitted for the most
extensive operations, firm with bone, yet not weighty with flesh;
they bend inwards or turn outwards, they rise upwards or stoop
downwards, and they throw themselves into whatever direction we
please.&nbsp; To these are annexed the <i>Hands</i>, and all
terminated by the <i>Fingers</i>, which give a most graceful
appearance, yet destined to almost incessant employ; though the
extremities or the fingers are an assemblage of the finest
fibres, most acutely sensible; for this reason our Almighty Maker
has overlaid them with an horny substance called <i>Nails</i>, to
preserve the tender part from dangerous impressions.&nbsp; Above
all, is <i>the Head</i>, a majestic dome, designed for the
residence of the Brain; ample to receive it, strong to uphold it,
and firm to defend it.&nbsp; This stately Capital, is screened
from heat, defended from cold, and at the same time much
beautified by a copious growth of Hair, which no ways encumbers
the wearer.&nbsp; This is the <i>outward</i> Man, the noble work
of the great God our Saviour, who became man for our sakes.</p>
<p>It is equally as wonderful to notice the <i>Inside</i> of this
house; with the amazing arrangement of Fibres that unite the
several Limbs of the Body, tough and strong.&nbsp; The small
<i>Membranes</i> appointed, enwrap the fleshy parts, to part
some, and form a connection with the others.&nbsp;
<i>Arteries</i>, some of which ascend to the Head, others spread
themselves <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>over the shoulders; some extend to the Arms, and others
descend to the Feet.&nbsp; <i>Veins</i>, these are appointed to
receive the blood from the arteries, and reconvey it to the
heart.&nbsp; <i>Glands</i>, whose office it is to filtrate the
passing fluid; an assemblage of <i>vessels</i>, complicated and
intervolved with seeming confusion, but with perfect
regularity.&nbsp; <i>Muscles</i>, wove in natures finest loom,
seem composed of the slenderest fibres, yet indeed with
incredible strength; these, with their tendons, constitute the
instruments of motion; not like a sluggish beast, but quick as
lightning.&nbsp; <i>Nerves</i>, surprisingly minute tubes,
derived from the Brain, which gliding into the Muscles, set them
on work, depress the power of sensation through the body, or
returning upon any impression from without, give all needful
intelligence to the soul.&nbsp; The <i>Skin</i>, like a curious
surtout, exactly fitted, is superadded over the whole, formed of
the most delicate net work.&nbsp; The <i>Pores</i> are minute,
and nervous fibres are multiplied even to a progeny.&mdash;The
Veins beautifying the human structure, especially the most
conspicuous parts of it; the pliant wrist and the taper arm, are
adorned with them, they spread vermillion over the lips, and
plant roses on the cheeks; while the eye, tinged with glossy jet,
or sparkling with the blue of Heaven, is fixed in an orb of
polished chrystal.</p>
<p>The grand means of keeping up this wonderful frame, is a point
worthy our attention; for this <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>purpose it is furnished with the
powers of nutrition.&nbsp; <i>Teeth</i>, the foremost thin and
sharp, fit to bite asunder, or cut off such a portion as the
mouth can conveniently manage: those which are broad and strong
are qualified to grind in pieces whatever is transmitted to their
operation.&nbsp; The <i>Throat</i>, the <i>Stomach</i>, with its
various operations and appendages, which are so admirably
constructed, I leave you to muse upon.&nbsp; There are but two
things more I have time to notice.&nbsp; High in the Head, and
conspicuous, as a star in the evening, is placed the
<i>Eye</i>.&nbsp; This is one of the greatest works of our
blessed Creator, consisting only of simple fluids, inclosed in
thin tunicles: it conveys to our apprehension all the graces of
blooming nature, and all the glories of the visible
heavens.&nbsp; The <i>Eye</i> so particularly tender, that a
slight accident, scarce perceivable by any other part of the
body, would be very injurious to its delicate frame.&nbsp; It is
intrenched deep in the Head, and barricadoed on every side with a
strong fortification of bones, defended by two substantial
curtains, hung on a slender rod, which secures it from every
troublesome annoyance.&nbsp; The <i>Ear</i>.&nbsp; The structure
of this organ is so wonderful that God claims it as his own work,
<i>He that planted the Ear</i>.&nbsp; Amazing nice and exact must
be the formation and the tension of the auditory nerve, since
they correspond with the smallest tremors of the atmosphere:
these living chords, tuned by an Almighty hand, receive the
impressions of <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>sound, and propagate them to the Brain.&nbsp; These give
existence to the charms of music, and the entertainment of
discourse.&nbsp; I must not enlarge&mdash;read the whole of that
Chapter, and no doubt you will be well entertained.</p>
<p>But while I would admire this noble work of God, I rejoice
that Jesus has taken my nature, and lives in it for ever; and
that he will raise my frame from the disgrace of corruption,
earth, and worms, to glory, happiness, and God.&nbsp; I am at the
same time deeply affected with the miseries of my fallen nature,
in consequence of sin; this has injured all its fine powers,
damaged every room in this wonderful house, so that in
consequence of the bad tenants which occupy it, the Almighty
landlord has ordered us to quit it.&nbsp; We have received by
many a pain, a writ of ejectment, but being unwilling to leave
this clay frame, though in such a damaged state, the owner and
builder of this house takes it down by degrees, which, Solomon
mentions in the following four verses.&nbsp; Ah! my brother, what
has sin done! the pains, miseries, strife, and agonies introduced
into our poor bodies, and distress into our souls.&nbsp; Permit
me here to mention that affecting description which the Angel
gave to Adam, soon after his fall, as represented by
Milton.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;Immediately a place<br />
Before his eyes appear&rsquo;d, sad, noisome, and dark;<br />
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>A lazar
house it seem&rsquo;d, wherein were laid<br />
Numbers of all diseas&rsquo;d; all maladies,<br />
Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms<br />
Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,<br />
Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,<br />
Intestine stone and ulcer, colic-pangs,<br />
Demoniac phrensy, moping melancholy,<br />
And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,<br />
Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,<br />
Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.<br />
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; despair<br />
Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch;<br />
And over them triumphant death his dart<br />
Shook, but delay&rsquo;d to strike, though oft invok&rsquo;d<br
/>
With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.<br />
Sight so deform&rsquo;d what heart of rock could long<br />
Dry-ey&rsquo;d behold?&nbsp; Adam could not, but wept,<br />
Though not of woman born; compassion-quell&rsquo;d<br />
His best of man, and gave him up to tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this sight let us turn, likewise, and consider the
infinite love and condescension of God our dear Saviour, who took
all our infirmities, bore our sickness, and knows how to
sympathize with our poor natures in all their sorrows; and such
an High Priest became us; such a Saviour is exactly adapted for
all our miseries; and hence he is called a Physician of value, he
healeth all our diseases, and surely the mind is awfully diseased
with sin, nothing but his skill can penetrate into the depth of
the diseases of the mind; whatever may be the ailments of the
body, they are but emblems of <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the diseases of the soul; the
blindness of ignorance, the deafness of spiritual unconcern, the
fever of concupiscence, the jaundice of malice, the swelling
tympany of pride, the vertigo of inconstancy, the quinsey of
cursing and blasphemy, the dropsy of covetousness, the palsey of
stupidity, the pleurisy of envy, the rheumatism of discontent,
the delirium of constant levity, the moon-struck madness of
passion and rage, with unbelief, hardness of heart, temptations
of Satan, and the stings of conscience, of whatever disease we
may feel we have got; these the adorable Physician heals.&nbsp;
Let us carry all our hard cases to him&mdash;<i>See Brown&rsquo;s
Tropology</i>.&nbsp; We are always welcome to him, and though he
may not seem to notice our case for a season, yet he will in his
own appointed time.&nbsp; This text has often been very precious
to my soul, <i>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be
gracious to you&mdash;and therefore will he be exalted that he
may have mercy upon you</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, The earthly house of our tabernacle shall soon be
dissolved, it has got the plague in it, the plague of leprosy,
and the house is condemned to come down.&nbsp; Leviticus
xiv.&nbsp; <i>He shall break down the house</i>, <i>the stones of
it</i>, <i>and the timber of it</i>, <i>and all the mortar of the
house</i>, <i>and he shall carry them forth out of the city into
an unclean place</i>, even to the grave, till the last trumpet
shall sound, and the tabernacle be raised again, beautiful and
glorious, like the human nature of our most glorious Covenant <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Head; and
this will be thy lot, O Theophilus, as sure as the trumpet of the
Gospel ever quickened your soul.</p>
<p>I shall add no more, but my prayers for you, as I trust I have
your&rsquo;s for me.</p>

<h2><i>LETTER VII</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO MRS.
D&mdash;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Peckham</i>, <i>July</i> 11,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall"><i>MY DEAR FRIEND</i></span>.</p>
<p>MAY the Father of Mercies and God of all consolation be with
you, as your all in all, the foundation of your soul, the shield
of your faith, the helmet of your hope, the length of your days,
the joy of your mind, the strength of your heart, and your
portion for ever.</p>
<p>I think, a few months ago you requested, and I promised you, a
few remarks on the 12th of Ecclesiastes.&nbsp; Having repeated it
in the Pulpit in a Sermon, I will how endeavour to give you my
opinion <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>in
the most literal and spiritual manner I can, with all due
deference to superior judgments; and humbly submit my sentiments
to the whole Church of Christ, which is the pillar and the ground
of the truth.</p>
<p>It has been asserted that Solomon was the wisest of all men;
here I beg leave to differ, I humbly conceive he was not so wise
as Adam, before the fell; nor perhaps so wise as the Apostle
Paul: but when it is said he was the wisest of men, it must be
considered merely in a political point of view; as God blest him
with much natural wisdom, so that he was able to manage the
affairs of the Nation without a Parliament, and to try all causes
without a Bench of Judges; this was indeed a great work, and the
Lord fitted him for it, by a spirit of wisdom and understanding,
which he requested of the Lord.&nbsp; He was the wisest man,
therefore, in natural things, that perhaps ever lived since the
fall.&mdash;He collected and framed three thousand Proverbs, and
a thousand and five spiritual Songs.&nbsp; He was well versed in,
and well explained the nature of Herbs and Animals of every
kind.&nbsp; Solomon had several books to study, the Book of the
Ceremonial Law, which is often alluded to in the Proverbs, the
Book of the Moral Law, out of which he was taught his need of a
Mediator, and a better righteousness than his own, to justify him
before God, the Book of all the scriptures that were then
extant.&nbsp; Into <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>these he was deeply led.&nbsp; He had the book of
nature, and appeared to be a Master of all the Sciences of
natural and spiritual Philosophy.&nbsp; He was well skilled in
Astronomy, in Botany, and Anatomy; the last he shews his skill
in, as this last chapter of the Preacher shews.&nbsp; This book
was probably written in his old age, after his recovery from his
fall, and God had healed his broken bones.&nbsp; Age and sorrow
coming on him, he felt the decline of mortality, urges the
necessity of spiritual knowledge and practice, while health lasts
and God furnishes a man with opportunities, knowing that the
mental faculties would soon decay, however bright they might have
been.&nbsp; These are set forth in three verses.&nbsp; He then
notices the decay of the human frame&mdash;its weakness, and how
every limb and joint, every power and passion, every member and
faculty is affected, either by age, sickness, or trouble.&nbsp;
The Lord, indeed, sometimes sends for his dear people,
suddenly.&nbsp; He snatches them away from the power of enemies,
and the evil to come; but others are gently gathered, not hastily
plucked.&nbsp; God takes down our tabernacle a pin at a time, and
loosens the cords just as we are able to bear it; gives kind
warnings, and then appears like a cloud of the latter rain.&nbsp;
This gradual decay Solomon pays a particular attention to, he had
noticed it in others, perhaps began to feel it himself; and
having called the Body an House, he describes its timbers, its
strong beams, its supporters; <i>in the day when the keepers of
the house shall tremble </i><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span><i>and the strong men bow
themselves</i>.&nbsp; The almost universally received opinion of
these <i>Strong men</i>, <i>the keepers of the house</i>, is,
that they signify the <i>Hands</i> and <i>Feet</i>, which include
the <i>Shoulders</i>, the <i>Arms</i>, and <i>Hands</i>, the
<i>Thighs</i>, the <i>Legs</i>, and the <i>Feet</i>.&mdash;These
Hands and Arms are the keepers of the house, for when the
scripture speaks of preserving, defence, and deliverance, the
Hands and Arms are generally mentioned, besides, they keep the
house by providing for it, getting maintenance for the whole
body.&nbsp; <i>These Hands</i>, says Paul, <i>have ministered to
my necessities</i>: these protect the house, and also keep off an
adversary; these tremble through age or infirmities, as
experience shews; and this includes all weakness and inactivity
of those parts in this condition, whether they are outward, as
stiffness and contraction, or inward, as aches, pains, numbness,
palsies, cramps, and tremblings.&nbsp; Thus the Keepers
tremble.&nbsp; The wise Man then descends to notice the inferior,
the <i>Feet</i>, containing these parts in connection, the
Thighs, Legs, Ancles, and Feet.&nbsp; These are the strong men;
sometimes they are called the Strength of a man; and the Spouse
is setting forth the majesty and glory of her beloved, in his
strength, by this text, <i>His legs are as pillars of marble</i>;
and because the great strength of a Man lays in these parts,
therefore in his infirm and weak condition, these parts must
become more eminently weak.&nbsp; As the diseases which affect
the superior part, also affect the inferior, as the rheumatism,
gout, and such like, the keepers <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>and the strong men are subject to a
similarity of diseases; and the learned say they are in the
original exprest nearly alike&mdash;<i>The keepers of the house
tremble</i>, <i>and the strong men shall nod</i>, <i>or
shake</i>.</p>
<p>The next part of this shakey house the Wise Man observes, is
the <i>Grinders</i>; these cease, because they are few.&nbsp;
Grinding, all men know to be performed by two hard bodies, the
one immovable, on which the Grinding is made, the other movable;
which by strong compression against the former, and by its
motion, makes the grinding.&nbsp; The upper and the nether
millstone, as the scripture calls them, the firm stander, and the
strong mover.&nbsp; Now, similar unto these in a mill, there are
for that grinding which is performed in the mouth, two jaw-bones,
the upper and lower; the upper admits no movement at all, the
lower is movable, and so both perform that act called
mastication, or chewing.&nbsp; Out of these jaw-bones proceed a
certain number of small bones, we call <i>Teeth</i>&mdash;these
are the proper <i>strict</i> instruments of grinding.&nbsp; By
the ceasing of the Teeth, we must understand all those
infirmities that are incident to them by reason of age, whether
looseness, hollowness, rottenness, brokenness, blackness, or
whatever else may be an impediment to them in their use; for as
age comes on, the natural moisture at the root of the teeth is
consumed, and a preternatural is distilled in its room: thus as
the teeth drop out, and very few are left in it, the chewing in
the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>mouth
ceaseth, more so than when there is none at all, for then the
gums might act one against another.&nbsp; But when the grinders
are few, they hinder those from working, and having no
antagonists they are not able to work themselves, and so the
whole grinding ceaseth, which is a great symptom of the decay of
life, at least of a state of weakness.</p>
<p>The next great object which we are called to observe, is, the
<i>Decay</i> of <i>Sight&mdash;Those that look out of the
windows</i>, <i>are darkened</i>.&nbsp; I believe none has ever
questioned but this means the eyes, and the infirmities of them
in old age.&nbsp; One may be said to look out of a window, when
he looks through the glass of the window, or when he looks
through the open casement.&nbsp; Now a man could not look through
a window, if it was not made of glass, or something of the kind,
neither could he perceive any thing with his eye were not the
parts thereof which the passage is made of, the very same
substance.&nbsp; The parts of the eye through whose bodies the
visible <i>species</i> must pass, that they may be discerned, are
either the humours, or the tunicles; the humours are three, the
watery, the chrystalline, and glossy humour, so Anatomists call
them; and however they differ, yet they are all instrumental to
vision.&nbsp; The tunicles or coats, through which the sight is
made, are only two, though there are others which conduce to the
sight, yet there are but two through which the beams of light
pass; the first is as fine <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and curious as a Spider&rsquo;s web,
and being derived from the Brain and optic Nerve, it becomes a
vestment for the humors, and is pellucid and transparent.&nbsp;
The other is an hard and horny membrane, and encompasseth the
whole body of the eye, without perforation, and on the back part,
behind the sight of the eye is more obscure and dark, but on the
fore part is far more plain and clear.&nbsp; Solomon observes
these <i>lookers out of the windows to become dark</i>, that is,
as age enfeebleth the eye the form and figure becomes more plane
and depressed than it was before, and the chrystalline humor,
which had a power of reducing itself, now becomes dry and
altogether unfit for such an end, which must breed a confusion in
the sight.&nbsp; As age comes on, and increaseth, it is well
known the sight goeth away, the lookers out of the windows must
be darkened.&nbsp; We have scarce any description in scripture of
an old man and his infirmities, but the decrease of sight is
mentioned, their eyes were dim, and they could not see.</p>
<p>I hope you will pardon this very short description of the eye,
as it is a very large subject, and a vast deal may be said open
it, which I reluctantly omit, lest I should swell this letter to
a volume.&mdash;Thus my dear friend, our poor bodies in sickness
and age, are compared to an old house, with its teams, pillars,
and windows, terribly shattered; condemned by the Parish to come
down.&nbsp; But I <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>cannot let this letter pass without the promise of
another.&nbsp; May your confidence increase, and abound more and
more in this blessed truth, <i>If this earthly house of our
tabernacle is dissolved</i>, <i>we have a building of God</i>,
<i>an house not made with hands</i>, <i>eternal in the
heavens</i>&mdash;there may we meet.&mdash;Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain ever yours in Jesus,</p>

<h2><i>LETTER VIII</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO MRS.
D&mdash;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Peckham</i>, <i>July</i> 21,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall"><i>MY DEAR FRIEND</i></span>,</p>
<p>What an unspeakable blessing it is for you, that the Holy
Ghost has enabled you to rejoice in hope of eternal glory, and
put that expression in your mouth, as well as the hope and
confidence in your heart, <i>I know that if this earthly house of
my tabernacle were dissolved</i>, <i>I have a building </i><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span><i>above</i>,
<i>an house not made with hands</i>, <i>eternal in the
heavens</i>&mdash;this is in your hope, and a God of truth has
declared your expectation shall not be cut off.&nbsp; The blessed
Spirit is promised to all the Elect seed, as the earnest of that
promised rest.&nbsp; While the glorious operations of that
self-same Spirit, are designed to prepare us for that glorious
inheritance.&nbsp; My dear Sister has, I trust, been long taught
the sad state of man by nature, that though he was originally
built for God to dwell in, and his image did reside in man a
little while, yet an enemy came against this little City,
besieged it, and raised awful bulwarks against it, gained the
possession of the capital, and keeps it in peace, till the
stronger than he, even the eternal Spirit comes on him, spoils
him of his armour, makes him quit his territory, and gets full
possession of his heart.&nbsp; Solomon well instructed in the
operations of the Spirit, under the emblems of old age and its
infirmities, points out this work in striking, figurative
language.&nbsp; <i>In the days when the keepers of the house
shall tremble</i>, <i>and the strong men shall bow
themselves</i>.&nbsp; We are not at a loss to conjecture who
those keepers are in the worst of senses, Satan having blinded
the eyes of man, it is his work, to study how to keep them blind,
keep them enemies, keep them in prejudice, keep them proud, and
keep them in awful rebellion.&nbsp; This is the work of the
devil, nor is he at a loss for means to carry on this work.&nbsp;
Religious systems, and erroneous preachers, are the Devil&rsquo;s
under-strappers, <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>by whom he carries on his infernal work.&nbsp; Hence the
out-cry made against the truth, whenever and wherever it is
preached; the endeavours to stop the progress of truth in the
world, lest the light of the glorious Gospel should shine into
the heart, and poor sinners be saved.&nbsp; These strong keepers
of the house tremble at the approach of the light of the Gospel,
and as soon as it comes in power they must submit, bow
themselves, relinquish their claim, and turn out, knowing they
come in by art, and with a view to deceive the house, that it
might share the same fate as devils do.&nbsp; But viewing this
subject experimentally, the Spirit coming to convince of sin, to
apply the law to the conscience, and to shew us the works of the
devil, at his coming these keepers tremble, but we do not find
them gone, till the power of the Gospel is felt.&nbsp; Many have
trembled at the curse of the Law; at the preaching of the Law as
Felix did, when Paul reasoned of judgment, temperance, and
righteousness.&nbsp; It is one thing for a criminal to tremble in
his chains, and another for Satan to be overthrown.&nbsp; Satan
will maintain his seat in the heart as long as he can, but God
says, <i>I will overturn</i>, <i>overturn</i>, <i>overturn
it</i>, <i>until he comes</i>, <i>whose right it is</i>; <i>and I
will give it him</i>.&mdash;There is nothing Satan hates so much
as light, when this comes into the mind he is discovered, his
works hated, and the poor sinner votes against both him and his
works, cries unto the Lord because of these oppressors, while his
hope springs up in the Gospel <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>news, that the Son of God was
manifested in the flesh, that he might destroy the works of the
devil, as the power of the word is felt, as grace reigns, so
these keepers and strong ones bow, and like the soldiers at the
sepulchre, the keepers thereof became as dead men.&nbsp; When the
Angel of the covenant descends to open the prison doors, the poor
prisoner comes forth as Peter did, from his prison, though the
keepers stand at the door they are not able to retain the
captive; hence the question, <i>Shall not the prey be taken from
the mighty</i>?&nbsp; <i>Shall not the lawful captive be
delivered</i>?&nbsp; Yes, blessed be God it is the mighty work of
God the Spirit to cast down the strong holds of the devil, carnal
enmity, pride, prejudice, and self-righteousness; when these are
demolished, Satan has no hope of the damnation of such a soul;
though the poor sinner himself cannot perhaps see his own part
and lot in the salvation of the Gospel; he may still remain in
bondage to the fears of death, the dread of hell; unbelief still
prevails, doubts, fears, and sad despondency may still operate to
keep the soul in misery, till the Holy Ghost favours it with an
increase of faith, gives it strength enough to believe in his
love, in his Person and in his glorious Work; then we enter into
rest.&nbsp; This is done by believing the report of the Gospel,
by believing such precious truths as these: <i>He shall finish
transgression&mdash;he shall make an end of sin</i>.&nbsp; <i>He
shall magnify the law</i>.&nbsp; <i>Blotting out the handwriting
contained in Ordinances</i>, <i>that was against </i><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span><i>us</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ye are complete in him</i>,
<i>having forgiven us all our trespasses</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have
loved thee</i>, <i>I have redeemed thee</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have
blotted out as a cloud thy transgression</i>, <i>and as a thick
cloud thy sins</i>.&nbsp; <i>He hath made to meet on him the
iniquities of us all</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Lord is well pleased with
his righteousness sake</i>.</p>
<p>Now, my dear friend, I can assure you that I always feel peace
and joy in believing these precious truths for myself; they are
for such poor sinners as I have described; but faith to receive
these precious things is the gift of God.&nbsp; And this work of
God carries us above our strong fears and doubts, which are as
much the corruptions of the human heart as our sins.&nbsp; This
glorious conquest of the keepers and strong men is sometimes
achieved by sensible tokens, clear deliverances, and open
manifestations; it was not so with me, but it has been the happy
experience of many who have had much legal bondage; not favored
with a clear ministry of the word, and when God intends them
either for much suffering or for public usefulness.&nbsp; I have
often wished it my case, but I should be sorry to endure what
many have, nor would I murmur that my heavenly Father has not
drove me into such awful deeps.&mdash;This portion of scripture I
get into very well; <i>to you which believe he is precious</i>;
yea, he is preciousness itself: This I find true in my
experience, and it is enough to convince me that the good work is
begun, that the work is of God, and must terminate <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>in an
exceeding and eternal weight of glory.&nbsp; Thus we see, feel,
and admire the conquests of sovereign Grace; this brings us to
God, this endears the Saviour, this inspires us with a lively
hope, this turns our feet to God&rsquo;s testimonies, opens the
eyes to see the beauty of God&rsquo;s word; the glories of the
Saviour, and imbitters, yea, darkens all terrestial
objects.&nbsp; The eyes by nature are full of evil, they are
fixed on sinful objects, they are full of sin.&mdash;Hence we
read of <i>eyes full of adultery</i>.&nbsp; We read of lofty
eyes, and of an evil eye, the one signifies pride of
self-righteousness, the other of a churlish, envious
disposition.&nbsp; These eyes must become dark, dim, and least
exercised as grace reigns.&nbsp; The lust of the eye is, and must
be the grief of all who feel it; with this temptation Satan beset
poor Eve; she saw the tree was good; she soon fell after
this.&nbsp; Satan plied this to the Saviour, but in vain.&nbsp;
He shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
them, in a moment of time.&nbsp; The eye is the inlet of sin;
hence Job says, <i>I have made a covenant with my eyes</i>;
<i>why then should I think on a maid</i>.&nbsp; Job xxxi, verse
1.&nbsp; The power of almighty grace most effectually <i>at
times</i>, affects the very sight of the believer, and makes him
delight in looking into the Word of God, and employing even his
very eyes as well as every other faculty, in the good ways of
God; and as these are open to every thing that is good, they must
be darkened to what is evil, neither the heart nor the eyes of a
believer, <i>as converted</i>, <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>are designedly set to evil; but when
the one wanders and the other slides back from God, it is then
the soul mourns,</p>
<blockquote><p>Prone to wander, Lord I feel it,<br />
Prone to leave the God I love!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Subject may lead us to further experimental remarks, I do
not decidedly pretend to fix the mind of the Holy Ghost on this
passage, but while I contemplate the keepers of the house, in the
worst sense, may we not look at them in a better point of view;
as faith, hope, fear, and love, the christian&rsquo;s keepers;
the believer&rsquo;s strong men, who have done much for the
Church.&nbsp; Paul has given us a whole chapter on what faith has
done, 11th of Hebrews.&nbsp; Hope keeps us at an anchor, firm in
our confidence, though it may be small in enjoyment.&nbsp; Fear
will never let us wholly depart from God, while love bears us up,
and carries us through difficulties, duties, and dangers, and
abides with us for ever.&nbsp; These graces are not self-active,
they cannot act but as the Spirit keeps them up; they are always
in us as spiritual principles, but they are set always active,
though perhaps all the ways in which they operate are not known
to us.&nbsp; These are very strong in time of tribulation; at
least in most cases.&nbsp; Faith is tried deeply when guilt is
felt on the conscience, when Satan roars, when the mind is
distressed, when outward circumstances run crooked; then faith
often <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>leans towards the Atonement; trusts in an unseen, though
not an unknown God; waits on God till light springs up, and is
looking for suitable promises to support the soul, to plead with
God, and to animate the mind at a future day.&nbsp; Thus faith
keeps us from sinking.&nbsp; <i>I had fainted unless I had
believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the
living</i>.</p>
<p>But Solomon found some days in his experience when these
keepers were not so strong; when these strong men bowed through
weakness, and when his sight was not so well occupied, nor his
mind quite so clear.&nbsp; He found something, as Sampson did,
which weakened his strength, which might have made him question
the reality of his faith, the sincerity of his love, and the
foundation of his hope, when he found the hedge of Godly fear
broken down, and himself at a sad distance from God, befooled in
his old age, and led into awful idolatry.&nbsp; When conscience
was awakened, and the hand of God was upon him, he then found the
keepers were weak indeed; Love had been out of exercise, and the
inordinate love of women came in; fear was out of exercise, and
idolatry was soon practised, a sin God detests more than any
other.&nbsp; Faith was inactive, and hope at a low ebb, so that
Satan stept in when these keepers were weak.&nbsp; And is not
this, at times, the painful experience of God&rsquo;s Elect, in
their degree?&nbsp; Do we not find every sin indulged weakens the
graces of the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Spirit, beclouds our evidences, and brings us low; so
that as soon as trouble comes on, we find neither faith nor hope,
nor love, nor fear, nor zeal, nor spirituality.&nbsp; A worldly
spirit, levity, evil tempers, giving way to our most easy
besetment; hearkening to Satan, conforming to the world, or
medling with erroneous sentiments.&nbsp; These things will
weaken, and make the strong men tremble.&nbsp; Guilt felt, sin
creeping in between conscience and God, and faith not strong
enough to make use of the Atonement; this makes us tremble
indeed, while the eyes of an illuminated understanding become
very dim&mdash;this darkness we feel when we can neither see the
way behind nor before with pleasure.&nbsp; Ah! how painful, how
truly wretched is this for God&rsquo;s children&mdash;<i>but the
backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways</i>.&nbsp;
What a painful subject is this I am writing to you; but yet it is
necessary to know these things; such knowledge is painful, but it
is good to write thus to warn, having tasted this bitter cup
myself.&nbsp; Here we see the necessity of abiding continually in
Jesus, keeping near him, that we may have peace maintained in the
conscience; be kept from sin, and led on in the ways of God,
strong in faith, cheerful in hope, fervent in love, and tender in
conscience.&nbsp; May that be your felicity and mine, dear Sister
in Jesus, is the earnest prayer of ever yours in Jesus.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Peckham</i>, <i>August</i> 4,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall"><i>MY DEAR FRIEND</i></span>,</p>
<p>GRACE and peace be yours.&nbsp; I am come to visit you once
more with pen and ink, though I am not able to come in person to
see you.&nbsp; This is a means of conversation the Almighty has
afforded us, nor can we be too thankful for it, as we may write
to each other on those momentous subjects which concern our never
dying souls; nor can the pen be better employed than in stirring
up each other&rsquo;s mind, by way of remembrance.&nbsp; Time
with us both is short; you are farther advanced in years than I
am, but both are going to our Father&rsquo;s house; let us
therefore follow that advice of the Wise Man&rsquo;s while we
can, <i>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do</i>, <i>do it with all
thy might</i>, <i>for there is no work</i>, <i>nor device</i>,
<i>nor knowledge</i>, <i>nor wisdom</i>, <i>in the grave whither
thou goest</i>.</p>
<p>It is the work of faith to lay hold of eternal <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>life.&nbsp;
The knowledge of faith gives present peace; the wisdom of faith
is to cleave to God, and the art or device of faith is to
endeavour to gain all it can, to be useful to others.&nbsp; This
faith leads us to think God&rsquo;s thoughts, and approve of
them; to do what Jesus has commanded&mdash;to carry our cases to
God; to search diligently into his word, and to open the mouth
for God when we have an opportunity.&mdash;Faith opens the mouth
to God in prayer and praise, and for God&rsquo;s glory, in a
firm, warm, decided attachment to his cause, his people, his
ways, his truth; and while we are favoured with health and means,
let us improve them.&nbsp; The faculty of speech, the opening of
the lips, and the exercise of the lungs, should be all employed
in his service and to his glory, who died, the just for the
unjust, to bring us to God.&nbsp; Age, infirmities, trials, and
death itself, will soon put an end to these; let us therefore
employ them while we can, and in the lively hope of glory, may we
sing, with the excellent <i>Cowper</i>,</p>
<blockquote><p>And when this lisping stammering tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies silent in the grave,<br />
Then in a nobler sweeter song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sing thy power to save.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence Solomon exhorts to these things in your favourite
chapter, which I glanced at in my last letter.&nbsp; He reminds
us of the solemn period to which we are all hastening, <i>when
the doors shall be shut in the street</i>; <i>the sound of the
grinding be low</i>, <i>and </i><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span><i>he shall rise up at the voice of
the bird</i>, <i>and all the Daughters of Music shall be brought
low</i>.</p>
<p>I believe I have already intimated that Solomon, was well
versed in the science of Anatomy; that he well understood the
human frame, and perhaps much better than any before him.&nbsp;
He had in the former verse spoken of the Animal System; in this
fourth verse he proceeds to notice the Natural Faculties, inward
and outward.&nbsp; A great writer says these words form but one
sentence: <i>The doors shall be shut in the streets</i>, <i>when
the sound of the grinding is low</i>.&nbsp; This Grinding is
supposed to relate to almost every part in man, which is
preserved, kept up, and supported by food, and respects the
alteration which that food undergoes, that it may be really
transubstantiated into our flesh.&nbsp; These are by Physicians
called digestion or concoction.&nbsp; By the <i>sound</i> of the
Grinding is meant some natural symptoms which are expressive of
digestion, and prove that all things are right in the bodily
frame, which a want of digestion would prove to the
contrary.&nbsp; The voice of the Grinding is the natural appetite
of the stomach to meat and drink, and is what we call hunger and
thirst after food, with the strength and power of the stomach to
retain what it receives, and nourishes the whole body.&nbsp; This
Grinding and its voice takes in at once all the excellencies of
nature, while they are in power; but, as age comes on, all the
indicators of strength and concoction must be <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>depraved,
diminished, and abolished.&nbsp; Loss of appetite, with all its
attendants, is the lowness of the voice of this Grinding; the
doors of course are shut in the streets.&nbsp; When this is the
case with a sickly, feeble, aged body, the mouth, the throat, in
speaking, and the stomach in receiving food; the nostrils, and
the eyes, which are called doors, these are all affected and must
weaken as nature ceaseth to perform its original offices.&nbsp;
Thus these doors are shut in the street when the Grinding is
low.&nbsp; The Streets are the several passages of the body,
which the matter of nourishment passeth through, and are the
roads and highways to and from the places where the Grinding is
performed.&nbsp; May not this expression likewise refer to the
inability of the sick, feeble, and aged, to encounter with the
noise and bustle of business; and to the doors and shutters shut,
as a signal of the departure of some of the family; and the voice
of singing, even of common cheerfulness is altered.</p>
<p>Solomon gives us another intimation of the weakness of the
human body&mdash;listlessness of repose, easily awakened.&nbsp;
<i>He shall rise up at the voice of the Bird</i>.&nbsp; His age,
or sickness, is like the wealth of the rich man, it will not
suffer him to sleep; in the night he may have some unquiet
drowsiness, but the approach of morn, when healthy young people
sleep sound, he shall be broad awake, and at the crowing of the
cock, or the singing of a Bird, <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>he shall be rising up from his
sleepless bed.&nbsp; Hence the saying, The singing of Birds and
the sighing of old Men are generally contemporaries&mdash;these
are as soon weary of their lodgings, through the pains and
wakefulness in the night season, as the Birds are for lifting up
their pleasant notes.</p>
<p>The last remark in this verse is, <i>The Daughters of Music
shall be brought low</i>.&nbsp; These Daughters are considered by
those skilled in Anatomy, to be both active and passive, such as
make Music and such as receive Music; the active make a Music
themselves, or bear a part in it; the other delights in that of
which they have not the least share in making.&nbsp; There are
three several kind of organs that do more immediately, yet
distinctly and gradually, conduce to the production of vocal
Music; the first is the Lungs, which are the proper instruments
of our breathing; the second sort of organs that conduce to
music, are such as form the Breath into the Voice, or
Respiration, the Tongue, the Palate of the Mouth, the Teeth,
especially the four Front Teeth, and, lastly, the Lips: these
form the sound into a Voice; the others that modulate this Voice
into Music, are the cartilaginous parts of the Wind-Pipe; the
head of the Wind-Pipe is very small, yet it has thirteen Muscles
belonging to it, most of which are framed only for the modulation
of the Voice.&nbsp; Some shut the Pipe, some open it, some
dilate, some contract it, so that acting severally or <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>jointly,
according as there is occasion, they do wonderfully conduce to
the variation of sound.&nbsp; This also has got five Cartilages
some are moveable, some immoveable, some of one form, others of
anther, that they may better contain the air and break the Voice
into Melody.&nbsp; This is the Pipe to sing the high praises of
God with, and which infinitely excels all the Instruments of
Music: these are the active Daughters of Music which are brought
low through age; the passive Daughters of Music are the organs of
hearing; these are inward and outward; the outward Ear is spread
abroad like a net, that it may gather and catch the sound as it
rolls about the ocean of the air; the inward ear is a great
secret, that no one can possibly understand&mdash;all have
confessed their ignorance of this great matter; the first part we
meet with is a thin strong membrane, which being placed over the
Hole of the Ear, transversely, divides between the inward and the
outward Ear; within this there are three Cavities, and three
little Bones.&nbsp; So likewise there is implanted in the Ear a
pure, subtil, and quiet air, with the filaments of the auditory
Nerve; and then the whole Nerve itself.&nbsp; By the help of
those several parts our hearing is thus performed; in age the
several holes and Cavities of the Ears are stopped; the drum is
unbraced; the hammer is weakened, the anvil is worn, the stirrup
is broken, and the inward air is mixed and defiled; the filaments
are dulled, the nerve itself is obstructed, so that there <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>cannot but
follow heaviness of hearing.&nbsp; Hence old <i>Barzillai</i>
complains to David, 2 Samuel, xix, 35, <i>I am this day eighty
years old</i>, <i>and can I discern between good and
evil</i>?&nbsp; <i>Can I hear any more the voice of singing men
and singing women</i>?&nbsp; <i>Wherefore should thy servant be
yet a burden to my lord the king</i>?&nbsp; Thus the habit and
taste for Music is brought low.&nbsp; This appears to be the
literal sense of this passage, and some of those unpleasant days
which many of our fallen race see with grief; all must lament it
as creatures, but yet Believers must rejoice, as new creature,
that all their musical days are not at an end&mdash;no, but that
they are only beginning, as son as they enter upon their
Father&rsquo;s house above, and in the resurrection morn their
harps, their powers, will be sweetly tuned to the praise of
electing grace and eternal love.&nbsp; Permit me here to insert
those lines from the hymn just quoted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord I believe thou hast prepar&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unworthy tho&rsquo; I be,<br />
For me a Blood-bought, free reward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden harp for me.<br />
&rsquo;Tis tun&rsquo;d and strung for endless years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And form&rsquo;d by power divine,<br />
To sound in God the Father&rsquo;s ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No other name but thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In once more looking over this verse, my mind is impressed
with other ideas, which I must commit to paper and send to my
dear friend.&nbsp; We read in <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>sacred Writ of the Door of the Heart,
and of the Door of the Lips, and of the Conscience: these Doors
are all opened by the finger of God.&nbsp; The conscience is
quickened to feel the native guilt of our sins; the heart, the
mind, all the faculties of the soul are opened by the operations
of the eternal Spirit; the Understanding is enlightened to
perceive the glories of the Saviour; the Will is bowed down to
chuse Jesus, the Affections are set upon him, the Thoughts love
to retain him; thus the Door of the Heart is open.&nbsp; Hence
the Spouse says, <i>He put in his finger by the hole of the
Door</i>, <i>and my bowels were moved for him</i>, <i>I rose up
to open to my beloved</i>.&nbsp; The Door, here, may signify
Faith in her heart; the Hole of the Door, a principle of love,
though not wide open, free, and at sweet liberty, yet, as a
principle, it was there.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus putting forth his
powerful grace in the heart afresh, stirred her up, opened all
the faculties, and afresh quickened the Conscience, she was led
forth in soul after him.&nbsp; This is opening the Door.&nbsp;
Hence he addresses the Laodicean Church; <i>Behold I stand at the
door and knock</i>; <i>if any man hear my voice and open the door
I will come into him</i>.&nbsp; This text has been awfully
perverted by the Arminians and Modern Calvinists of the day: they
tell us that the Deity is knocking at the door of every
man&rsquo;s heart, begging to come in&mdash;waiting till the
creature will open the door, and receive salvation!&nbsp; Alas!
what a most miserable perversion of the text.&nbsp; The passage
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>has
nothing to do with the World, it is an address to the Church in a
backsliding state, as the 5 Chapter of Songs shews.&nbsp; The
Church knew her Beloved&rsquo;s voice, which is the Gospel.&nbsp;
Every enlightened, quickened soul, understands the truth, whether
it is drowsy or not; the soul is again made willing to receive
Jesus, to seek most ardently the best of friends: this is opening
the door, as we are made willing in the day, the time, the moment
he puts forth his power.&nbsp; This is what the Church means by
<i>the Beloved putting forth his hand by the Hole of the
Door</i>.&nbsp; The heart moved after him, the door of the lips
is opened, in prayer, in entreaty, and when admittance is gained,
they are opened in praise, and in speaking good of his
name.&nbsp; <i>They shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom</i>.&nbsp; Thus the doors are opened for the King of
Glory to come in.&nbsp; These are everlasting doors and will
never be fully shut against Christ, nor will his doors ever be
shut against his Church.&nbsp; He manifests himself to us, and we
entertain him with the fruits of his own Spirit.&nbsp; The
Grinders cease in the best of senses.&nbsp; The worst oppressors
we ever meet with is a broken Law and a tempting Devil, and
accusing conscience, this is the trouble of the Spirit.&nbsp;
Hence that fine passage, <i>They shall cry to the Lord because of
the oppressors</i>.&nbsp; <i>He shall send them a Saviour</i>,
<i>a great one</i>, <i>and he shall deliver them</i>.&nbsp; The
manifestation of pardon eases the conscience; the testimony of
the Spirit that we are complete in Christ&rsquo;s righteousness,
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>silences
the Law, and the Saviour&rsquo;s great Work, pleaded by himself
as an Advocate with the Father, drives off the Devil.&nbsp; Thus
these oppressors cease, because they are few.&nbsp; A Believer
can bear and endure any thing while all is right within, between
God and the soul; not that he is rid of the inbeing of his sins,
or the temptation of Satan, these will often oppress him; nor
will they fully cease till he lays down his poor body in the
grave.</p>
<p>Another sweet priviledge, <i>He shall rise up at the voice of
the Bird</i>.&nbsp; This is a most blessed truth in our
experience, for the gospel attended with power stirs up all our
faculties, and we follow hard after God.&nbsp; This voice as used
by the ministers of the word, is called <i>The time of the
singing of Birds</i>.&nbsp; The Gospel Dispensation is called a
spring time, and when the love of Jesus is felt casting out fear,
when the storms of sin cease, by the voice of pardoning mercy,
this sweet text is well understood: <i>My beloved spake</i>,
<i>and said unto me</i>, <i>rise up my fair one</i>, <i>and come
away</i>, <i>for lo</i>, <i>the winter is past</i>, <i>the rain
is over and gone</i>; <i>the time of the singing of Birds is
come</i>.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus, and the blessed Spirit of all
Grace, are called Birds, and their voice is heard, known, and
felt.&nbsp; <i>My Sheep hear my voice</i>, <i>and follow
me</i>.&nbsp; These leave all when Jesus speaks by the Spirit to
their souls; while every kind promise, every sweet invitation,
and every precious declaration, form the sweet voice of Jesus, in
the <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>word
and in the souls of them that believe.&nbsp; The Ministers of the
Gospel are called Birds, and when they are understood and the
power of their message is felt, the soul yields the obedience of
faith.&nbsp; Conscience, approving and taking part with the man,
as his experience is genuine, is a Bird, and is called by
Solomon, <i>a Bird of the air</i>; this accuses or approves as
God the Spirit influences it.</p>
<p>Thus, in the best of senses, we read this text; but, alas! we
must take another view of it, as alluding to some evil days the
soul may experience in passing through this valley of Bochim, or
Weeping.&nbsp; We find the saints of old at times had the Doors
of their Hearts and Lips shut as well as open.&mdash;One said,
<i>I am shut up</i>, <i>I cannot come forth</i>.&mdash;Another,
<i>I go bound in the Spirit</i>: Another, <i>I was dumb</i>,
<i>and opened not my mouth</i>.&nbsp; Ezekiel was dumb for seven
days before the people, as a Preacher, and in the streets of
Zion, that is among the inhabitants of Gospel Zion.&nbsp; This
has been often experienced to their grief, shut up in prayer,
either reluctantly going to the exercise, or else finding but
little access there; hurrying through the act.&nbsp; Hence the
charge against one of old, <i>Thou restrainest prayer before
God</i>.&nbsp; Job did not say such did not pray, but they were
not open, free, familiar, or staid at the throne till liberty was
felt; but the act was performed merely to quiet conscience.&nbsp;
At times in company, dumb almost about the things; and <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>though the
voice, the lips, the tongue, the lungs, were sweetly exercised
before, <i>yet these Daughters of Music are brought low</i>, for
they neither sound with prayer or praise, or godly conversation,
or reproof, or comfort, to any other!&nbsp; Thus these Doors are
shut in the streets.&nbsp; Conscience is, however still awake,
and the poor Believer is alarmed; is startled at the voice of
that Bird, when listening to its accusation of sin committed, of
duty neglected, of a worldly spirit of levity or covetousness, or
of some corruption given way to, or permitted to lie on the
conscience.&nbsp; Thus the voice of the Bird is heard, and it is
well to listen to it, lest another day it should fill the soul
with horror and sorrow.&nbsp; This is what David felt after a
long series of months, with guilt on his conscience, till Nathan
came with his Parable; but not knowing what it meant, he vows
vengeance against the man that did it, <i>That he should surely
die</i>.&nbsp; This was indeed true, for it was David&rsquo;s
wayfaring man, the man of sin, that came to steal the ewe Lamb;
but David rose up at the voice of this Bird, and life went with
the word to David&rsquo;s soul, <i>Thou art the man</i>.&nbsp; He
felt it, conscience was afresh awakened, and it is our mercy to
have the life of God in the Conscience; for the main difference
between the Christian and the mere nominal Professor, lays in
this; the one has got all his religion in his Head, and if that
was cut off, he would have none; the others lays in his
Conscience, as pardoned by blood, and quickened by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Another evil day we may find in this dark state, when
so sadly shut up, is the fewness of them that preach all the
truth as it is in Jesus: Hence the Church in her sad state ran to
some who did not know her case; of course we find they ceased to
give advice.&nbsp; She ran to others; they only rebuked her, and
added affliction to her bonds, doubted her interest in the
garments of Salvation.&nbsp; Hence she says, <i>The watchmen
found me</i>; <i>to whom I said</i>, <i>Saw ye him whom my soul
loveth</i>?&nbsp; Then again in the 5th Chapter, <i>The watchmen
met me</i>, <i>they wounded me</i>; <i>they smote me</i>; <i>they
took away my veil from me</i>: and sure I am that nothing can be
more trying than for a soul in such intricate paths not to be
able to find one to suit its case; and if they do, the word not
being attended with power, they get neither light nor life.&nbsp;
These are called Teeth in scripture, as they prepare food, break
the bread of life, make all things plain, easy, and intelligible
to the people; fixed in their Covenant Head, harmonize and agree
in sentiment, at least in the main points, and engaged in the
same work.&nbsp; These may cease by death&mdash;<i>the
Prophets</i>, <i>do they live for ever</i>?&mdash;by removals in
providence far from the abode of such a soul as I have been
describing; or they may not be blest much to tried souls.&nbsp;
They may be few in number, and those cease, as it respects their
usefulness to some; so that, though they were once <i>as a lovely
song</i>, <i>and as one who could play well on an instrument</i>,
yet they may get <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>dry, barren, and lifeless; at least, apparently so for
any use they may be to a soul in the above circumstances.&nbsp;
The make us mourn, nor can the Daughters of Music make melody
again till he shines.&nbsp; We are compared Instruments of Music,
set in tune by the Spirit, but can make no Music till he touches
the chords of the heart; then upon the instruments of ten
strings, he gets praise.&nbsp; The Doors of his Heart, his House,
his Table, and his Throne, will never shut against you, any of
his children.&nbsp; The days of your Mourning will soon end, the
voice of Jesus will call you at the glorious resurrection of the
just, when you will rise up at that voice, and sigh and sin no
more.&mdash;<i>Hallelujah</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO MRS.
D&mdash;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Peckham</i>, <i>August</i> 30,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall"><i>MY DEAR FRIEND</i></span>,</p>
<p>I once more resume my pen to give you a few more thoughts on
the 12th of Ecclesiastes, but lament the limits, of a Letter, or
even a Sermon would be too short to do justice to that
subject.&nbsp; The Wise Man has in the verses we have already
considered, described age to us, in the influence it has upon all
the functions and faculties of a man; and shews how they are all
weakened in his declining state.&nbsp; He now proceeds to notice
one sad effect of age, that is, <i>Fear</i>.&nbsp; Verse 5,
<i>Also they shall be afraid of that which is high</i>, <i>and
fears shall be in the way</i>; <i>and the Almond tree shall
flourish</i>, <i>and desire shall fail</i>, <i>and the
Grasshopper shall be a burden</i>, <i>because man goeth to his
long home</i>, <i>and the mourners go about the streets</i>.</p>
<p>The first is <i>Fear</i>, either of things high or low.&nbsp;
<i>He shall be afraid of that which is high</i>, either in <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>respect of
place or objects; as steep, and eminent ways, hills, mountains,
steeples, and towers; some of which formerly they could ascend
without fear, in their juvenile and manly days; but it is not so
now, they are weak in mind, nervous, low, timid, and fearful; so
they are afraid of high things, as fiery meteors, strange
apparitions, thunder, lightning, and such like.&nbsp; So they are
likewise, probably, afraid of abstruse and mysterious points in
any science, which while strong, they durst have ventured upon,
but now they are too weak in the faculties to dive deep into
them; they are always in fear lest tiles of houses, or chimney
pots, or any thing else should fall on them, especially in windy
weather.&nbsp; They have fears about them constantly on all
hands; they see danger, lest they should dash their foot against
a stone; lest some people in their hurry should push them down,
or should rush upon them, and injure them.&nbsp; Being conscious
of their own impotency, it makes them most obnoxious to this
terrible passion, which is the great change made on them in the
time of age.&nbsp; Thus Solomon notices the change made in the
mind by sickness, trouble, and age.&nbsp; He then points it out
clearly upon the body in the next line, <i>The Almond tree shall
flourish</i>.&nbsp; The learned tell us, this tree waketh, and
riseth from its winter&rsquo;s repose before any other, it
flowers in the month of January, and by March bringeth its fruit
to maturity.&nbsp; The forwardness of this fruit-bearing tree is
intimated by the vision which Jeremiah <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>had of the
speedy Destruction of Jerusalem; <i>For the word of the Lord came
to Jeremiah</i>, <i>saying</i>, <i>what seest thou</i>?&nbsp;
<i>And he said</i>, <i>I see a rod of an Almond tree</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Then said the Lord</i>, <i>thou hast well seen</i>, <i>I will
hasten my word to fulfil it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Jeremiah</i>, 1
chapter, <span class="GutSmall">XI</span> verse.&nbsp; This was
to shew the speedy fulfilling of the word of God against that
City.&nbsp; Now there is no change that befalleth man, that can
be so lively represented by the blooming of the Almond tree, as
that whereby the hair of the head becomes hoary and white.&nbsp;
The grey head is similar to this tree, for its whiteness, so in
hastiness of appearance, as the Almond tree buds sooner by two or
three months than most other trees, so do these hasty buds of age
appear; these steal upon men suddenly before they are
aware.&nbsp; Some peoples&rsquo; hair turns grey at thirty or
forty years of age, while other symptoms of the decay of life do
not appear on them till sixty or seventy years of age.&nbsp; Both
these attract attention.&nbsp; An Almond tree in full blossom,
and an almond head, especially if found in the ways of God, these
are alike in their indications, they foretel what is
approaching&mdash;a change; fruit will come after; so grey hairs
prognosticate that death is at hand; these are Church-yard
flowers, which serve, like passing bells, to give those notice
that bear them, that their end is near.&nbsp; Two things more the
Wise Man observes; <i>The Grasshopper shall be a burden</i>,
<i>and desire shall fail</i>.&nbsp; The learned say the word
<i>Grasshopper</i>, likewise signifies the Locust, and will <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>apply to
both in the original language; and they likewise suppose that
Solomon here alludes to some parts of the body, which being
shrivelled and deformed, appear like the Locust and
Grasshopper.&nbsp; These Species are both of them hard, crusty,
cragged, crumpling creatures, differing from all others,
principally in the protuberance of the limbs, having their legs
strangely crooked, and their joints very closely inverted, and at
a great distance from the trunk of their body.&nbsp; This
description may refer to some of the bones in the neck, the back,
the loins, the heels, and the ancles.&nbsp; Now when a man by
reason of age, begins to stoop, and bend forwards, and withal
those fleshy parts that cover these processes, begin to shrink
and decay, he resembles these creatures.&nbsp; This may also
include the change upon the cartilages of the body, the
Ligaments, the Membranes, the Fibres, the Veins, the Nerves, the
Arteries, the Tendons, and the like, which all grow harder and
drier in old age, and become a burden; the skin, likewise, as man
declines, becomes crusty, dry, callous, and consequently falls
into many wrinkles.&nbsp; This may also include that fretfulness
to which aged people are subject; every thing is a burden, though
light, weak or trifling as a Grasshopper.&nbsp; Good Mr. Henry,
observes, Perhaps this Grasshopper or Locust was some light food,
such as John did eat; but even this was a burden to an aged
man&rsquo;s stomach; then, of course, through these things
Solomon well adds, <i>Desire shall fail</i>: Sensual <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>and natural
desire for food, pleasure, or any sensual delight whatever.&nbsp;
This word <i>Desire</i>, the celebrated Dr. Smith says, should be
translated <i>Capers</i>, the fruit, or rather the flowers of the
Caper Shrub, or Bush; and alludes to something calculated to give
appetite; and that as the Grasshopper did represent the Bones, or
hard parts of the Body, so these the soft, spongy, and dilated;
and what Solomon by this expression means, is the alteration of
all the moist and tender parts of the body, usually called the
Sanguineous; including the change that befals the Blood, and the
natural Humours of the Body in time of age, for they become low,
and much depauperated; they are diminished and far less in
quality than they were before.&nbsp; The reason of this
<i>is</i>, <i>for man goeth to his long home</i>, <i>and the
mourners go about the streets</i>.&nbsp; The grave, said Job, is
my house, and soon the funeral proclamation must be repeated over
us, <i>Dust thou art</i>, <i>and unto dust shall thou
return</i>.&nbsp; The grave is the home for the body, when once
it comes there, as long as there is any dust to cover it, or
heavens to surround it, Man lieth down, and riseth not till the
Heavens be no more; they shall not awake, nor be raised out of
their sleep till death is swallowed up in victory.&nbsp; <i>And
the mourners go about the streets</i>.&nbsp; This we see daily;
the friends, the relations, characters of every
description.&nbsp; Mourning, is not because my friend is gone to
glory, but on account of the loss I sustain, that person being
near and dear to me; besides, it is <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>a solemn call, <i>Be ye also
ready</i>, <i>for in such an hour as ye think not</i>, <i>the Son
of Man cometh</i>.&nbsp; And oh, my dear friend, to have the lamp
of salvation from sin, its guilt, and curse, and power, and to
have my soul filled with joy in God, through Jesus&mdash;this is
the oil which will blaze when he appeareth.&nbsp; But if I have
not much joy, I am blessed with a good hope, through grace; a
hope that maketh not ashamed, and God declares it shall never be
lost; <i>There is hope in thy end</i>, <i>and thy expectation
shall not be cut off</i>.&nbsp; Praise ye the Lord.</p>
<p>I would again glance at this Text in another sense.&nbsp;
Having considered the evil days coming on the body in this verse,
let us once more survey some days of evil, in which I am sure you
and I can say I have no pleasure in them.&nbsp; <i>Fear shall be
in the way</i>, <i>and the Almond tree shall flourish</i>; <i>the
Grasshopper be a burden</i>, <i>and desire shall fail</i>, <i>for
man goeth to his long home</i>, <i>and the mourners go about the
streets</i>.&nbsp; Without turning, twisting, or wresting this
Text, I am forcibly struck with the following thoughts, which I
must pen and send you.&nbsp; 1st.&nbsp; The Believer&rsquo;s
home.&nbsp; 2ndly.&nbsp; The way to it.&nbsp; 3rdly.&nbsp; The
fears which attend him.&nbsp; 4thly.&nbsp; Their cause, which is
a source of grief, and causes the spiritual mourners to go about
the streets of Zion.&nbsp; I know of no dwelling or resting
place, for a soul born of God, but the everlasting love of God in
Covenant; the Person and Work of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
This is my habitation, my dwelling, my <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>resting
place; nor is there any safety, happiness, felicity, or peace,
any where else.&nbsp; All that are born of God, naturally, in
this sense, tend to this one grand object.&nbsp; Hence the
question of a seeking soul, Does God love me?&nbsp; Did Jesus die
for me?&mdash;and after the soul knows this, yet in general,
there is a thirsting after greater knowledge, and greater
enjoyment of it, nor is a Believer ever at home but when he is
here.&nbsp; He rests not in his attainments of this knowledge,
but is anxious to go on to know the Lord, in his infinite love;
to feel more, to enjoy more, to be delighted with more of it,
till he arrives at perfect bliss, and is filled with all the
fulness of God, which is love.&nbsp; He tastes what the poet did,
and has exprest in these two lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis heaven to rest in thine embrace,<br />
And no where else but there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is our resting place, as Faith apprehends it in its
antiquity, its freeness, power, complacency, and beneficence: It
is truly delightful to eye the goings forth of this Love, in the
ancient settlements, in the covenant engagements of each Person
in the adorable Trinity, in the gift of Jesus to the Church, in
his great work, and wonderful Person, as God-Man Mediator, in the
Gifts of the Spirit, and all his saving operations upon the soul,
testifying of Christ, as putting away sin, as obeying the Law, as
delivering us from going down into the pit, and making
intercession for us.&nbsp; On these topics we, who have the Life
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>and love
of God, are quite at home; especially as the Holy Ghost realizes
them in our hearts; for this we labour in Spirit, to know and
enjoy; and this one point we wish to die to know, and to plunge
in this sea of bliss.&mdash;To view the Father&rsquo;s love, the
Son&rsquo;s dear face, and the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s Grace, in
Heaven, are objects worth dying for; this is the home, the place,
the state, the mansions of peace, rest, joy, satisfaction, and
pleasure, we hope to get to shortly.&nbsp; This is our long home,
eternal as the throne of God.&nbsp; No foe shall ever enter
there.&nbsp; No friend shall ever depart&mdash;they shall go no
more out; so shall we be ever with the Lord.&nbsp; This is our
everlasting home, nor will our Lord let us rest short of
this.&nbsp; There may we meet soon, Amen.</p>
<p>But do you ask me, 2ndly.&nbsp; The <i>way</i>?&nbsp; It is
clearly set forth in the word, and I hope you have long known it,
and highly approved of it, and been led into it; nor shall you
ever finally depart from it.&nbsp; The word of truth says, I am
<i>the</i> way; not <i>a</i> way, but <i>the</i> way.&nbsp; Ah,
my dear Friend, how lamentable that thousands are deluding their
souls with this unscriptural notion, that all the sects, parties,
and religious denominations in the world, are only as so many
different ways to one city.&nbsp; Hence they suppose the Turk,
the Pagan, the Papist, the Socinian, the Arian, the Arminian, and
the Antinomian, are all going right, and some out of all these
will be saved as such.&nbsp; Alas, what an error; there <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>never was
but one way to God, to heaven, and to glory, and that is Christ,
as the adorable Mediator; all that reject this will find to their
grief, that <i>whatever</i> way they went it led to the chambers
of death; it led to hell.&nbsp; What a mercy to be satisfied with
a precious Saviour, and to hear the voice of the Word and Spirit
pointing to him, saying, <i>This is the way</i>, <i>walk ye in
it</i>.&nbsp; Christ is the way to the Father, to the knowledge
and enjoyment of his love.&nbsp; By the sacrifice he offered, by
his perfect law-fulfilling Righteousness, by the path he trod as
our fore-runner, by the Door of Hope that he opened, by the way
of life he cast up, and consecrated through the vail of his
flesh, by the doctrine he taught, by the example he set, and by
the promise of life and peace.&nbsp; We are brought into this way
by the Holy Spirit of Promise, and kept in it by the same, with
an eye to Jesus, as the way.&nbsp; We walk in his appointments,
in his ordinances.&nbsp; We use them to gain the knowledge of the
Pearl of great price.&nbsp; By waiting upon him we renew our
strength, and by abiding in him we bring forth fruit.&nbsp; This
way leads us to God, and will bring us to glory, assure as it
brings us to a sense of his love on earth.&nbsp; Many have waited
long, and travelled far in this way, before they have been very
fully persuaded of God&rsquo;s Love to them; but all shall have
their minds satisfied about that, though not all in the same
degree, as walking in this way of truth, way of holiness, way of
wisdom, way of charity, way of life, and way of peace.&nbsp; We
are <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>called Strangers, Pilgrims, Travellers, Runners in a
Race, and going a Journey.&nbsp; Our Pilgrim&rsquo;s Coat is an
imputed righteousness; our Staff is Christ; our Map is his word;
the Girdle is truth; our Shoes is peace; our Way is marked out
for us, omnipotent Power guards us, infinite Wisdom directs us,
Mercy is often shewed us, and eternal Love cheers us, while we
can sing with a Pilgrim who has reached glory before us,</p>
<blockquote><p>How harsh soe&rsquo;er the way,<br />
Dear Saviour still lead on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as this is God&rsquo;s way we must expect to meet with
enemies, with savage beasts of prey, with robbers, many a stormy
day, and many a dismal night, when neither moon nor stars appear
to cheer the Pilgrim&rsquo;s way, for it is our lot to travel
much by night; this begets fears lest we have come wrong, lest
this be not the right road.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s dear people are
unavoidably the subject of many fears; when the eyes are first
opened, they fear the wrath of God, they fear Death, Judgment,
and Eternity: these are high things.&nbsp; If they hear of
Christ, the Promises, and Ordinances, they fear to come to these
high things, or make use of them, lest they should presume.&nbsp;
Thus there are fears in the way, and many times after God has
raised the soul up to hope, they fear the work is not genuine;
they fear they shall fall into sin, and disgrace their <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>profession;
and feeling the power of sin, and the weakness of their souls,
they fear they shall at last fall away.&nbsp; When they see many
apparently brighter characters than themselves go back into the
world, or sink into error, they fear it will one day be their
case; and when they see how far a person may go in a profession
and yet be nothing, they startle, they fear, lest they
should.&nbsp; Thus we find fears in the way, and when the mind is
low, deprest, and every grace of the spirit, to all human
appearance out of exercise, they are afraid of high, great,
precious, and important Doctrines, lest they should presume in
medling with them, fearing they have no interest in them.&nbsp;
Sometimes fears of poverty, pain, persecution, and what we may
suffer in the agonies of death.&nbsp; These kind of fears may
come on us, and above all, the fears that all we have experienced
may be a delusion, and that hypocrites may come as far as we
have, talk better than we do, and give a better account of
themselves than we can; this makes us fear in the way.&nbsp; All
these fears is for want of looking unto Jesus, and permitting
Satan to get so much ground, by listening to his
suggestions.&nbsp; These fears, likewise, are occasioned by other
feelings, and trying parts of our experience.&nbsp; What Satan
principally aims at is to make us as miserable as himself, and as
rebellious against God; to this end he endeavours to get us to
look within in seasons of darkness, that we may dispute the whole
of the Spirit&rsquo;s work, and consider all our sins, failings,
and <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>corruptions as sure tokens of a speedy destruction,
just as Jeremiah saw the rod of an Almond tree speedily
flourishing; so might have been our profession, but soon gone
away.&nbsp; So we fear may be all our religion, and then be
damned for being hypocrites.&nbsp; O the misery of looking
within, when we should be looking unto Jesus!&nbsp; What a gloomy
prospect before us! what unbelieving fears are indulged; and this
must be our misery, till the Saviour shines again.&nbsp; But what
a mercy when we have grace enough to look from our sins, our
grace, our Religion, or any thing in us, or done by us, to God
the Father&rsquo;s Christ, who lived and died for poor
sinners.</p>
<p>A second source of fears is, Sin but little felt, so as to be
lamented, so as to break the heart, humble the spirit, and endear
the Saviour.&nbsp; It appears God sometimes sent the Grasshoppers
to devour the fruits of the earth, as in Amos, chapter 7, where
the Prophet foresees the Destruction of Jerusalem, by Pul, king
of Assyria, bringing his vast troop to devour that land, coming
up like Grasshoppers for their number and destructive
influence.&nbsp; So in the Book of Judges it is said, the enemies
came up among them as Grasshoppers for multitude to destroy
them.&nbsp; As these represented the enemies of God&rsquo;s dear
people of old, do they not point out the corruptions of the
heart, inbred sin, the Old man, with its deceitful lusts?&nbsp;
Are they not numerous is Grasshoppers, <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and as
destructive to every thing that is good?&nbsp; Do not these
destroy our peace, our joy, our bright evidences, and cause us,
sometimes, to fear we have neither part nor lot in the matter,
especially when we cannot see that these sins are pardoned by the
precious blood of Christ?&mdash;These are felt as a burden too
heavy to bear, and a burden we fear will sink us to hell, till we
believe they are all blotted out, then the inbeing of them
becomes a burden to us.&nbsp; But here we must admire divine
mercy, communicating to us spiritual life that we may feel these
things a burden.&nbsp; As this life operates the difference
between a child of God and one that is not, is clearly seen; they
who are not quickened by the Spirit do not feel these things;
but, alas, my dear Friend, have not you been left in such a
strange state of mind, that you have neither felt sin, nor grace,
neither mourned at the judgments of God, the terrors of hell, the
sufferings of Christ, the afflictions of the Church, nor the
plague of the heart.&nbsp; O! worst of states my soul ever was
in; this deadness, carelessness, dull, stupid, heavy frame, I
hate it, I lament it.&nbsp; Before this came on I could sigh
deeply on account of my sins, their number, and destructive
tendency, but now I have fresh fears that all is not right,
because I don&rsquo;t see sin such an evil as it is.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t groan beneath it; I don&rsquo;t lament my
vileness.&nbsp; Surely my soul cannot be right with God, while
this is the case; the Grasshopper is a burden, because it is so
light; <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>I
am burdened, because I don&rsquo;t feel sin that heavy, hateful
burden, I have felt it, and as others do.&mdash;Thus you see, my
dear sister, what poor, foolish, fearful creatures we are, how
discontented with the cross; when we feel much sin, we fear, and
when we scarcely feel it at all, then we fear also.&nbsp; Alas,
how much of poor Jonah&rsquo;s spirit do we all possess.&nbsp;
Murmuring, repining, rebelling.</p>
<p>But I must mention a third source of <i>Fear</i>, <i>The
failing of Desires</i>.&nbsp; The people of God are the objects
of his desire; Christ saw them in the glass of the Father&rsquo;s
decrees and purposes.&nbsp; He desired them.&nbsp; Hence the
Church triumphs in the Song, <i>I am my Beloved&rsquo;s and his
desire is towards me</i>.&nbsp; He desired the Church for
himself, and gained it, every one that he desired, in electing
grace, is brought to desire Christ, by calling grace, and one
blessed effect of being truly called, is the desire of the soul
towards God, to hold communion with him, to be like him, and to
be with him.&nbsp; Hence that sweet Promise will one day be
accomplished, <i>He will fulfil the desire of them that fear
him</i>.&nbsp; This will not be till we awake up in his likeness;
then, but not till then, shall we be satisfied.</p>
<p>These desires of the soul are highly commended by the Saviour,
as they spring from a feeling sense of need; are the pulse of the
soul, which beats for God.&nbsp; Many a poor Believer in seasons
of darkness, <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>has blessed God for the feeling desire, the hunger, the
thirst, the wish for what God has promised, and what the soul
feels its need of.&nbsp; But let me ask you again, have you not
found such days of evil, as the loss of these desires?&nbsp; No
life, no spirituality, no appetite, no earnestness, no fervent
desires, not a breath of the New man felt or seen; and to be left
in this state a considerable time, when all has been shut
up?&nbsp; I have still triumphed in my desires, but when
<i>these</i> have failed, all is dark, gloomy, wretched,
desolate.&nbsp; This has sent me mourning about the streets of
Zion, crying, <i>Saw ye him whom my soul loveth</i>?&nbsp; This
is the enquiry of souls who are afresh quickened to feel their
native guilt, their deadness, and want of the light of comfort,
of joy, of peace, and the testimony of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The
Saviour was sent to comfort them that mourn after a godly sort,
sorrowing after Jesus; to gain a sense of his love, a token for
good, a fresh view of pardon, and eternal life.&nbsp; This is
calculated to comfort the mourner in Zion, to cheer his heart,
and enable him to look forward to death and the grave, with sweet
composure, knowing Jesus is the conqueror of death, spiritual,
temporal, and eternal.&nbsp; To him, I commend you, and
remain</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO MRS.
D&mdash;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Peckham</i>, <i>September</i> 30,
1814.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>my dear friend in Christ
Jesus</i></span>.</p>
<p>I have been just reflecting a little on that glorious Title
and Office of our most blessed Lord, a <i>Surety</i>: the longer
I live the more I feel the need of him as such; the bondage, sin,
and misery I am daily and hourly experiencing, except a few sweet
seasons of liberty in prayer, preaching, writing, and conversing
about the precious things of God.&nbsp; It is well he became one
with us, in the eye of the law, that he kindly undertook for us,
and infallibly secured the payment of that obedience it demanded
of us.&nbsp; This whole debt he took upon himself, and crossed
our name from the bond, and addressed his divine Father for us,
<i>Whatsoever my people owe thee</i>, <i>put that to my
account</i>.&nbsp; The Father graciously accepted this, and has
declared himself well pleased with it.&nbsp; Every blessed view
of this gives me hope, peace, and rest.&nbsp; I am truly
miserable but when this is shewed me, then I feel <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>a sweet
serenity of mind.&nbsp; O! precious Surety, O! glorious Redeemer,
thy Person, thy Name, and thy Work, is very dear to my heart:</p>
<blockquote><p>No other stay have I beside,<br />
If these should alter I must fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need this to support me now, I shall need it as much when my
heart and flesh fail.&nbsp; <i>When the Silver Cord is
loosed</i>, <i>when the Golden Bowl is broken at the Cistern</i>,
<i>when the Pitcher is broken at the Fountain</i>, <i>and the
Wheel broken at the Cistern</i>, this glorious Saviour will then
carry my regenerated spirit to God who gave it me, and this is as
sure to my soul as that God has begun the good Work in it.&nbsp;
He begins it with a view to carry it on, and he will perfect that
which concerneth me, for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>I will now drop you a few thoughts on the sixth verse, with
which I must close these letters, which I trust you will candidly
read, and where I err, attribute that to me, but receive the
truth as from that God whose I am, and whom I serve.&nbsp; Here
are four symptoms of approaching dissolution; the first is <i>the
loosing the Silver Cord</i>.&nbsp; By this is most probably meant
the Spinal Marrow, and all the Nerves arising therefrom; with all
the Filaments, Fibres, and Tendons that proceed from those
Nerves; as there can be no motion or drawing <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>performed
in all the Body without these; and through the influence of the
animal Spirits upon them; and although these belong to the spinal
Marrow, and all draw together as it were, yet Solomon expresses
it in one word, <i>the Silver Cord</i>, because the rest are but
a continuation of the same thing.&nbsp; This is called the Silver
Cord from its colour, for it appears to the eye a white, bright
as silver; it is seated deep in the body; it lays lower and
deeper, and safer than the Veins or Arteries, or other common
conveyers in the Body, and it is reckoned the most excellent of
all, so that some Philosophers have termed it the Foundation of
Life.&nbsp; The loosing of this Cord, is an undoubted sign of
death; sometimes this is only affected in one part, and is the
cause of Paralytics, but when it happens to the head of the
spinal Marrow, it hinders the influence of the spirits upon the
whole Silver Cord, and consequently takes away all sense and
motion from all the subjected parts, and gives a sure prognostic
of death, especially in aged people.&nbsp; Thus the Silver Cord
is loosed.</p>
<p>The next object worthy notice is, <i>the Golden Bowl
broken</i>, by which some think is meant the Scull pan; or, as
the Seventy translate it, the Repository of the Brain.&nbsp; The
celebrated Dr. <i>Smith</i> (to whom I am indebted for many of
his ideas on Anatomy) says, there are two Membranes within the
Skull, a thicker and harder, and a thinner and finer, which does
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>more
immediately encompass the Brain, and by an immediate contact,
encircles the very Substance of it, which seems to me to be the
Golden Bowl, so called, by way of eminence, which is
broken.&nbsp; This is called Golden, for the same reason that the
other is called the Silver Cord, in its colour.&nbsp; The
Membrane is of a flavious colour, nearer to that of Gold; it is
hidden, secret, and well defended; and requires much wisdom and
time to find our all its secret caverns and mysterious branches,
and also for its ductility; above all, it may be compared to
Gold, for excellency and use.&nbsp; Now as long as man remains in
his strength, this Golden Bowl is knit unto itself in all its
parts, but in the event of extreme old age, when he is just
giving up the ghost, it can no longer retain itself, by reason of
its natural dryness, shrivelling into itself, or preternatural
moisture, imbibing excrementitious humours, till it is over full,
it often snaps asunder, and so recurs into itself, from whence
the Brain must naturally subside, and all the parts cease from
their several uses; upon this we perceive a change of the whole
countenance; the nose appears very sharp, the eyes sunk into the
head, the temples are pinched in, with all the other symptoms of
approaching dissolution.&nbsp; This brings the house down indeed,
when the animal faculty is so deeply affected.&nbsp; I think
there is something very interesting in the idea of the body
compared to a <i>Golden</i> Bowl, not China, Earthenware, or Tin,
but <i>Gold</i>, to shew how <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>precious our bodies are in his sight
who redeemed them; that he will take special care of them,
collect all the various pieces together, and raise them up a
glorious body by and by.</p>
<p>The third point worthy our consideration, is, <i>The Pitcher
broken at the Fountain</i>.&nbsp; This must refer to something
belonging to the vital faculty; it appears in sacred Scriptures,
that the life of man consists in his blood; <i>For the life of
all Flesh is in the Blood thereof</i>; and this most noble liquor
of Life, hath a primary Seat or Fountain, where it is principally
made, and from whence it is dispensed through the whole Body, and
this Fountain is the Heart, <i>for out of it are the issues of
life</i>.&nbsp; This part continually issueth out abundance of
Blood, wherein is the life, to all the parts of the
body.&mdash;This is a deep Fountain, it is the Fountain of Life,
the first living, and last dying Part of Man.&nbsp; Within the
Body of the Heart there are two firmly-divided Cavities, a right
and left, called Ventricles; from these are certain
vessels.&nbsp; Out of the right Ventricle, of the Heart, proceeds
the great Vein, which sends forth Branches throughout the whole,
and hath, at its entrance into the Heart, certain Portals, and
also an Artery.&nbsp; Out of the left Ventricle proceeds a Vein,
inserted into the Lungs, and also the great Artery, which
disperseth its Branches throughout the whole Body, both whose
Cavities are defended with the like Portals.&nbsp; How the blood
passeth in and <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>through these passages I have not time to describe, I
wish I had.&nbsp; By the Pitcher, therefore, we must understand
the true and proper concepticle of the Blood, namely, the Veins,
which throughout the whole body, serve only as vessels to contain
that noble liquor, and carry it back again to the Fountain.&nbsp;
This is the Pitcher here intended.&nbsp; The Fountain is the
right Ventricle of the Heart.&nbsp; But neither the Fountain nor
Pitcher continues for ever; the Pitcher does not go so often to
the Fountain but at last it comes home broken.&nbsp; The breaking
of it in old age, is the failing of the Veins, their ceasing from
their natural action and use; when they can no longer carry back,
nor conveniently pass into the Heart that liquor, the blood they
contain, it stops, it is stagnated, it dies in the Veins.&nbsp;
This is <i>breaking the Pitcher at the Fountain</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>The Wheel broken at the Cistern</i>.&nbsp; The
Cistern is the left Ventricle of the Heart, as the Fountain is
represented as the right; for the Blood being enlivened and
ennobled in the right Ventricle, it remains only to be dispersed
into these several parts it is to quicken, which it cannot
consequently do, except it be received into this Cistern.&nbsp;
The Wheel is that round, or circulation of the Blood which flows
from the left Ventricle of the Heart.&nbsp; Take this part of the
symptom of Death, the chasing of the Pulse; the instruments of
pulsation decay, and can no longer perform that work which must
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>necessarily be continued for the preservation of life;
when that ceases to beat, the man ceaseth to live; thus the
Wheel, which till now, run its constant round, is broken at the
Cistern, heart and flesh now fail.&nbsp; O! that when this is
your case and mine, we may have nothing to do but to depart and
be with Christ.&nbsp; May our Spirits return to God who gave
them, while the poor tabernacle returns to its original
dust.&nbsp; Solemn thought!&mdash;But the Gospel opens to my
wondering, pleasing view, the Resurrection of this Body, formed
and fashioned like the glorious Body of my Jesus, who appeared on
Mount Tabor, or Mount Lebanon, as perhaps we shall appear when he
comes in glory.&nbsp; May this be your felicity and mine,
<i>Amen</i>.</p>
<p>Do accept a few thoughts more upon this verse, of the evil
days which may come on the mystical Body of Christ, which is
drawn together, acts, moves, and is kept together by the strong
Silver Cord of everlasting love.&nbsp; <i>I drew them with the
Cords of Love</i>, <i>with loving kindness have I drawn
thee</i>.&mdash;This keeps the whole Body together; and Paul
tells us to <i>endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace</i>.&nbsp; Love is the bond; <i>put on charity</i>,
<i>which is the bond of perfectness</i>.&nbsp; This is the Cord
that draws us to heaven: this unites us in heart to Jesus.&nbsp;
Love as a principle, and as shed abroad in the heart, unites us
to his Truth, his Ways, his Ministers and his People.&nbsp; When
this is sweetly <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>felt, and especially in that degree the Apostle speaks
of, when perfect, that is eternal love comes in, it casts out
fear, which hath torment: to live under this influence is truly
blessed, but such seasons are short, they are pleasant days
truly; and in our first setting out, or some part of our
pilgrimage, we do experience them truly blessed.&nbsp; So did
Solomon, but he had some evil days, when his own corrupt heart
overflowed with sin, which brought on a sad distance between God
and his soul.&nbsp; This is also attended with a shyness to the
Household of Faith, and very few pleasant seasons in God&rsquo;s
House of Prayer.&nbsp; No love is felt to Jesus, and scarce a
desire after him; very little affection is felt to faithful
ministers, as there is but little received under their message,
which used to be so sweet to them, and their love to ministers so
strong, for the truth&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Thus, by contracted
guilt, the cord of love is loosed, not in God, but in our
exercise of this grace.&nbsp; So of those we once viewed saints,
many we have proved to be nothing but hypocrites; some only
mumping a living under the mask of religion; some lying in wait
to deceive; some watching for our halting, to find something
amiss in our conduct; and if they can catch any thing, it is
marrow and fatness to their bones.&nbsp; Tattling, lying,
backbiting, jealousies, and evil speaking.&nbsp; These things we
begin to discover, and groan on account of them in Professors,
till we can hardly help exclaiming with the Prophet, <i>There is
none upright among men</i>, <i>the </i><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span><i>best of
them is a briar</i>, <i>the most upright is sharper than a thorn
hedge</i>.&nbsp; Very little spiritual love being now felt, the
Silver Cord, appears to be loosed, not that the principle is
lost, but God is teaching the Believer wisdom, and directing the
principle of love to the proper object, even to the Household of
Faith&mdash;not to every Professor, but only to those who stand
manifest in our consciences, that they are taught of God; yet it
must be acknowledged that while the heart is shut up from the
exercise of love it is an evil, a trying day.&nbsp; Sin on the
conscience, backsliding, getting into a worldly spirit, the
affections being entangled with creature love&mdash;these things
bring on evil days.&nbsp; O! what a mercy to have the heart right
with God.&nbsp; When the soul is thus filled with love, it is
always attended with an illuminated mind, a mind receiving the
truth.&nbsp; Charity rejoiceth in the truth, believeth all things
God hath said, as well as hopeth for what God hath
promised.&nbsp; But it is possible to stumble upon the dark
mountains; God may cause darkness to come on the mind, the
judgment to be bewildered, and errors to creep in&mdash;the
Golden Bowl may be broken.&mdash;Ephraim, says God, is oppressed
and broken in judgment, either by evil men, who lay in wait to
deceive, or by a curious spirit, which a Believer may be plagued
with, till he has imbibed some error, which leads him into
darkness, bondage, and misery.&nbsp; A sound judgment is
valuable, like a Golden Bowl, but many of God&rsquo;s children
have got proud, and <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>God has permitted Satan to lay a
snare for their feet, <i>a haughty Spirit before a fall</i>, and
into awful errors they have run, till days of trouble have come
on, and they have found out their errors.&nbsp; Moreover, real
contrition for sin; a heart affected with grief after the
Saviour, mourning on account of him.&mdash;Compunction and godly
sorrow of heart is precious, is valuable to God; with this
sacrifice he is well pleased; this is a Golden Bowl broken
indeed, in the best of senses.&nbsp; <i>Blessed are they that
mourn</i>, <i>for they shall be comforted</i>.&nbsp; The Silver
Cord of Love, the Golden Bowl of a sound Judgment, and an heart
influenced by the Spirit of Grace, are in sweet connexion; these
make a Believer shine in the Church&mdash;such are valuable
characters, but they are few.&nbsp; <i>My soul desired the first
ripe Fruit</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Pitcher may be broken at the Fountain</i>.&nbsp; Our
Lord Jesus is a never-failing Fountain in his Person, in his
Offices, in his Love, and in his Work.&nbsp; He is the Fountain
of all spiritual and eternal Life.&nbsp; What a deep,
never-failing, abundant source of all good he is to his Covenant
People.&nbsp; He is a fountain of Gardens for his Church, a
Fountain of living Waters, and a Fountain opened for Sin and
Unclearness.&nbsp; Faith wrought in the heart, may be compared to
a Pitcher, which draws its supplies from that inexhaustible
source of all blessings.&nbsp; It receives the Atonement into the
conscience, it is the great Artery in the spiritual Body, which
conveys <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>peace and joy through the whole soul, as it receives
the precious Blood from the heart of Christ, and every other
blessing is in this one, <i>Jesus died for me</i>.&nbsp; While
Faith is thus busied, the exercises of Religion, like a wheel, go
their happy round to the Cistern of Gospel Ordinances; for a
while Faith is thus exercised on Jesus, the mind, the soul is
made willing, and rolls its happy round, like a wheel well
oiled.&nbsp; Faith is going to the Fountain while the Believer is
willingly running the way of God&rsquo;s Commands.&nbsp; It is
worthy our notice, that all the treasures of blessings in Christ,
are compared to a Fountain; but in Ordinances, in Ministers, and
Means, it is but a Cistern.&nbsp; Hence the folly of those who
seek salvation in their round of duties; they forsake the
Fountain, and cleave, in general, to those <i>Cisterns that can
hold no water</i>.&nbsp; Faithful Ministers and Gospel Ordinances
hold the Water of Life, and wisdom declares the man of
understanding shall draw it out.&nbsp; This I dare say you can
prove in your own experience; if your soul is, through faith in
the Person and Work of Jesus, happy in his love&mdash;all the
while the Pitcher of Faith is bringing you such supplies, you can
come as regular to the Cistern of Gospel Ordinances, and as
willing as a wheel, well set in motion, goes its round.&nbsp; In
such days of the Power of Faith, we are made willing to believe,
to do, to suffer, and to obey.&nbsp; Such days we have had, but
we have had some evil days besides, some opposite reasons, when
the Pitcher of Faith appeared to be <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>broken, for all the good it did for
us; it ceased to act, at least in the way it had done; it brought
no grace, no love, no joy, no comfort; it was like a Broken
Pitcher; not that it can cease to exist, as a principle, but only
in its motions, &rsquo;tis weak, low, and of course the mind must
be low, and the wheel move slowly, if it moves at all, in
Ordinances, in Conversation, in Prayer, in Reading, and every
other religious Exercise.&nbsp; Ah, my dear friend, have you not
met with such days of evil? <i>but all things work together for
good</i>, even those sins, those hindrances to our comfort, shall
terminate right; for <i>the elder sin shall serve the
younger</i>.&nbsp; Sin makes us pray, cry, groan, wrestle,
entreat; this makes Faith grow and increase, and what belongs to
God ascends to him, gravitates to its own centre.&nbsp; Faith
comes from him, is busied about him, affections go to him, hope
centers in him, patience waits on him, humility is precious to
him; this is the fruit of his own Spirit, and we find by daily
experience, that the Spirit goes to God who gave it, while all
that is carnal in us will cleave to the dust, to sin, to the
world, to all that is opposite to God; like loves its like,
<i>that which is born of the Spirit</i>, <i>is Spirit</i>, and
delights in spiritual objects; <i>that which is born of the Flesh
is Flesh</i>, and is desirous of sensual gratification.&nbsp;
This is the Believer&rsquo;s affliction; but we shall soon be
done with time, and commune upon an eternal scene, when all that
belongs to the earth, to the dust, will return to it, and all of
me, and belonging to me, will <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>return to him from whom it
came.&nbsp; The Lord carry on his Work in your soul and mine; and
while we live, may we be enabled, through all, and by all our
evil days, to distinguish between the Dust and the Spirit, the
Old-Man and the New&mdash;to watch the operations of both; lament
the one, and bless God for the other.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
